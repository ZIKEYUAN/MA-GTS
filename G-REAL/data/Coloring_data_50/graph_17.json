  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 17 major locations in the city: Mosaic Plaza, Gilded Archway, Union Square Market, Echo Station, Rosewood Hall, Yarrow Plaza, Umbra Theater, Lunar Pier, Haven Docks, Azure Gardens, Evergreen Circle, Lighthouse Point, Jade Fountain, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Amber Plaza, Twilight Harbor and Nimbus Plaza. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway, Rosewood Hall, Yarrow Plaza, Lunar Pier, Lighthouse Point, Twilight Harbor. \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, Evergreen Circle, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Nimbus Plaza. \nThe Union Square Market has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater, Lunar Pier, Azure Gardens, Evergreen Circle, Jade Fountain, Amber Plaza, Nimbus Plaza. \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, Lighthouse Point, Jade Fountain, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Twilight Harbor, Nimbus Plaza. \nThe Rosewood Hall has overlapping signal areas with Azure Gardens, Evergreen Circle, Lighthouse Point, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Nimbus Plaza. \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Evergreen Circle, Amber Plaza, Twilight Harbor. \nThe Umbra Theater has overlapping signal areas with Evergreen Circle, Lighthouse Point, Jade Fountain, Amber Plaza, Nimbus Plaza. \nThe Lunar Pier has overlapping signal areas with Haven Docks, Lighthouse Point, Jade Fountain, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Amber Plaza, Twilight Harbor. \nThe Haven Docks has overlapping signal areas with Azure Gardens, Evergreen Circle, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Twilight Harbor. \nThe Azure Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Jade Fountain, Amber Plaza. \nThe Evergreen Circle has overlapping signal areas with Jade Fountain, Amber Plaza, Twilight Harbor. \nThe Lighthouse Point has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral, Amber Plaza. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Amber Plaza, Twilight Harbor. \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Twilight Harbor, Nimbus Plaza. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 17 major locations in the city: Granite Plaza, Jasper Marina, Brass Lantern Tavern, Cobalt Market, Nimbus Plaza, Horizon Mall, Velvet Corner, Flint Forge Quarter, Jade Fountain, Lunar Pier, Copper Clock Square, Twilight Harbor, Skyline Gardens, Quartz District, Duskwood Park, Quarry Point and Echo Station. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Cobalt Market, Lunar Pier, Copper Clock Square, Quarry Point. \nThe Jasper Marina has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Velvet Corner, Flint Forge Quarter, Copper Clock Square, Echo Station. \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with Cobalt Market, Nimbus Plaza, Horizon Mall, Velvet Corner, Flint Forge Quarter, Jade Fountain, Lunar Pier, Copper Clock Square, Quartz District. \nThe Cobalt Market has overlapping signal areas with Nimbus Plaza, Lunar Pier, Twilight Harbor, Echo Station. \nThe Nimbus Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Horizon Mall, Flint Forge Quarter, Twilight Harbor, Duskwood Park, Quarry Point, Echo Station. \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Velvet Corner, Jade Fountain, Twilight Harbor, Quartz District, Echo Station. \nThe Velvet Corner has overlapping signal areas with Jade Fountain, Lunar Pier, Quarry Point, Echo Station. \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Jade Fountain, Skyline Gardens, Quarry Point. \nThe Jade Fountain has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier, Copper Clock Square, Duskwood Park. \nThe Lunar Pier has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens, Quartz District, Duskwood Park, Quarry Point, Echo Station. \nThe Copper Clock Square has overlapping signal areas with Quarry Point. \nThe Twilight Harbor has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park, Quarry Point. \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Quartz District, Duskwood Park, Quarry Point, Echo Station. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station. \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Quarry Point. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",
