  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 13 major locations in the city: Union Square Market, Skyline Gardens, Rosewood Hall, Zenith Arena, Quartz District, Umbra Theater, Beacon Tower, Mosaic Plaza, Granite Plaza, Willowshade Pavilion, Flare Alley, Quarry Point and Knight’s Market. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Union Square Market has overlapping signal areas with Rosewood Hall, Zenith Arena, Quartz District, Umbra Theater, Willowshade Pavilion, Flare Alley, Knight’s Market. \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Zenith Arena, Quartz District, Umbra Theater, Granite Plaza, Willowshade Pavilion, Flare Alley. \nThe Rosewood Hall has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower, Willowshade Pavilion, Quarry Point. \nThe Zenith Arena has overlapping signal areas with Quartz District, Umbra Theater, Mosaic Plaza, Granite Plaza, Willowshade Pavilion, Flare Alley, Quarry Point. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater, Mosaic Plaza, Willowshade Pavilion. \nThe Umbra Theater has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza, Granite Plaza, Flare Alley. \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with Knight’s Market. \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza, Flare Alley. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Knight’s Market. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference.

The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 13 major locations in the city: Ironbridge Crossing, Westgate Station, Gilded Archway, Flare Alley, Flint Forge Quarter, Riverstone Wharf, Silvercrest Observatory, Sapphire Arena, Nimbus Plaza, Duskwood Park, Skyline Gardens, Rosewood Hall and Pennywhistle Arcade. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Ironbridge Crossing has overlapping signal areas with Flare Alley, Riverstone Wharf, Silvercrest Observatory, Sapphire Arena, Duskwood Park. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory, Nimbus Plaza, Duskwood Park, Skyline Gardens. \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Flint Forge Quarter, Riverstone Wharf, Silvercrest Observatory, Duskwood Park. \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Flint Forge Quarter, Silvercrest Observatory, Sapphire Arena, Nimbus Plaza, Rosewood Hall, Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Riverstone Wharf, Silvercrest Observatory, Sapphire Arena, Skyline Gardens, Rosewood Hall, Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Riverstone Wharf has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory, Rosewood Hall. \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena, Duskwood Park, Rosewood Hall. \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens. \nThe Nimbus Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Rosewood Hall. \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Rosewood Hall. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 13 major locations in the city: Rosewood Hall, Copper Clock Square, Union Square Market, Zenith Arena, Westgate Station, Pennywhistle Arcade, Shadowbridge Arcade, Azure Gardens, Evergreen Circle, Primrose Boulevard, Horizon Mall, Silvercrest Observatory and Haven Docks. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Rosewood Hall has overlapping signal areas with Copper Clock Square, Westgate Station, Evergreen Circle, Silvercrest Observatory. \nThe Copper Clock Square has overlapping signal areas with Union Square Market, Zenith Arena, Westgate Station, Shadowbridge Arcade, Azure Gardens, Silvercrest Observatory. \nThe Union Square Market has overlapping signal areas with Zenith Arena, Silvercrest Observatory. \nThe Zenith Arena has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade, Shadowbridge Arcade. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade, Shadowbridge Arcade, Azure Gardens, Primrose Boulevard, Horizon Mall, Silvercrest Observatory, Haven Docks. \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Primrose Boulevard, Haven Docks. \nThe Shadowbridge Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Horizon Mall, Silvercrest Observatory. \nThe Azure Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Horizon Mall, Silvercrest Observatory, Haven Docks. \nThe Evergreen Circle has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory, Haven Docks. \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory, Haven Docks. \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Haven Docks. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 13 major locations in the city: Zenith Arena, Amber Plaza, Twilight Harbor, Umbra Theater, Silvercrest Observatory, Velvet Corner, Azure Gardens, King’s Row, Westgate Station, Cobalt Market, Quarry Point, Granite Plaza and Riverstone Wharf. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Zenith Arena has overlapping signal areas with Amber Plaza, Umbra Theater, Silvercrest Observatory, King’s Row, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater, Silvercrest Observatory, Velvet Corner, Westgate Station. \nThe Twilight Harbor has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory, Velvet Corner. \nThe Umbra Theater has overlapping signal areas with Velvet Corner, Cobalt Market, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with Velvet Corner, Azure Gardens, King’s Row, Westgate Station, Quarry Point, Granite Plaza, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Velvet Corner has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Westgate Station, Cobalt Market, Quarry Point, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Azure Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Quarry Point, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Westgate Station, Cobalt Market, Granite Plaza, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 13 major locations in the city: Jasper Marina, Granite Plaza, Jade Fountain, Evergreen Circle, Flare Alley, Twilight Harbor, Duskwood Park, Shadowbridge Arcade, Azure Gardens, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Umbra Theater, Silvercrest Observatory and Riverstone Wharf. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Jasper Marina has overlapping signal areas with Jade Fountain, Flare Alley, Twilight Harbor, Duskwood Park, Azure Gardens, Umbra Theater, Silvercrest Observatory. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Evergreen Circle, Shadowbridge Arcade, Azure Gardens, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Silvercrest Observatory, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Jade Fountain has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade, Azure Gardens, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Evergreen Circle has overlapping signal areas with Azure Gardens, Umbra Theater, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park, Silvercrest Observatory, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Twilight Harbor has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade, Umbra Theater, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Umbra Theater. \nThe Shadowbridge Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater, Silvercrest Observatory. \nThe Umbra Theater has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference.

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 13 major locations in the city: Evergreen Circle, Oakshade Library, Echo Station, Copper Clock Square, Pennywhistle Arcade, Quartz District, Azure Gardens, Beacon Tower, Flare Alley, Jade Fountain, Opal Theater, Brass Lantern Tavern and Yarrow Plaza. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas.

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 13 major locations in the city: Shadowbridge Arcade, Quarry Point, Ironbridge Crossing, Silvercrest Observatory, Azure Gardens, Riverstone Wharf, Yarrow Plaza, Dragon’s Gate, Westgate Station, Maplewood Conservatory, Lighthouse Point, Mosaic Plaza and Beacon Tower. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Shadowbridge Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Quarry Point, Silvercrest Observatory, Azure Gardens, Riverstone Wharf, Maplewood Conservatory, Lighthouse Point. \nThe Quarry Point has overlapping signal areas with Azure Gardens, Maplewood Conservatory, Lighthouse Point, Beacon Tower. \nThe Ironbridge Crossing has overlapping signal areas with Azure Gardens, Riverstone Wharf, Maplewood Conservatory, Lighthouse Point, Mosaic Plaza, Beacon Tower. \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with Riverstone Wharf, Dragon’s Gate, Maplewood Conservatory, Beacon Tower. \nThe Azure Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Riverstone Wharf, Mosaic Plaza. \nThe Riverstone Wharf has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, Lighthouse Point. \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Dragon’s Gate. \nThe Dragon’s Gate has overlapping signal areas with Westgate Station, Lighthouse Point, Mosaic Plaza. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Maplewood Conservatory, Lighthouse Point, Mosaic Plaza, Beacon Tower. \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 13 major locations in the city: Ironbridge Crossing, Silvercrest Observatory, Gilded Archway, Jade Fountain, Knight’s Market, Duskwood Park, Northwind Tower, Quartz District, Pennywhistle Arcade, Nimbus Plaza, Horizon Mall, Riverstone Wharf and Evergreen Circle. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Ironbridge Crossing has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway, Nimbus Plaza, Horizon Mall, Evergreen Circle. \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway, Jade Fountain, Duskwood Park, Horizon Mall. \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Quartz District, Pennywhistle Arcade, Nimbus Plaza. \nThe Jade Fountain has overlapping signal areas with Knight’s Market, Northwind Tower, Quartz District, Nimbus Plaza. \nThe Knight’s Market has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park, Quartz District, Pennywhistle Arcade, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Quartz District, Horizon Mall. \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with Quartz District, Horizon Mall, Riverstone Wharf, Evergreen Circle. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade, Horizon Mall. \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Nimbus Plaza, Evergreen Circle. \nThe Nimbus Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Riverstone Wharf, Evergreen Circle. \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Riverstone Wharf, Evergreen Circle. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference.

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 13 major locations in the city: Mosaic Plaza, Horizon Mall, Lunar Pier, Dragon’s Gate, Cobalt Market, Jade Fountain, Flint Forge Quarter, Echo Station, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Amber Plaza, Zenith Arena, Ironbridge Crossing and Temple Square. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Zenith Arena, Ironbridge Crossing. \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier, Jade Fountain, Flint Forge Quarter, Amber Plaza. \nThe Lunar Pier has overlapping signal areas with Flint Forge Quarter, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Amber Plaza, Zenith Arena, Ironbridge Crossing, Temple Square. \nThe Dragon’s Gate has overlapping signal areas with Amber Plaza, Ironbridge Crossing. \nThe Cobalt Market has overlapping signal areas with Jade Fountain, Echo Station, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Amber Plaza, Zenith Arena, Ironbridge Crossing. \nThe Jade Fountain has overlapping signal areas with Flint Forge Quarter, Zenith Arena, Ironbridge Crossing, Temple Square. \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station, Amber Plaza, Temple Square. \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with Amber Plaza, Zenith Arena. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Amber Plaza. \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Temple Square. \nThe Zenith Arena has overlapping signal areas with Temple Square. \nThe Ironbridge Crossing has overlapping signal areas with Temple Square. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference.

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 13 major locations in the city: Rosewood Hall, Opal Theater, Skyline Gardens, Knight’s Market, Twilight Harbor, Brass Lantern Tavern, King’s Row, Zenith Arena, Umbra Theater, Yarrow Plaza, Ironbridge Crossing, Riverstone Wharf and Westgate Station. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Rosewood Hall has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater, King’s Row. \nThe Opal Theater has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens, Knight’s Market, Zenith Arena, Umbra Theater, Yarrow Plaza, Westgate Station. \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Knight’s Market, Brass Lantern Tavern, King’s Row, Yarrow Plaza, Riverstone Wharf, Westgate Station. \nThe Knight’s Market has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Zenith Arena, Westgate Station. \nThe Twilight Harbor has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater, Yarrow Plaza, Westgate Station. \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Zenith Arena, Umbra Theater, Yarrow Plaza, Ironbridge Crossing, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Ironbridge Crossing, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Zenith Arena has overlapping signal areas with Ironbridge Crossing, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Umbra Theater has overlapping signal areas with Westgate Station. \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Ironbridge Crossing, Riverstone Wharf. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference.

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 13 major locations in the city: Opal Theater, Nimbus Plaza, Primrose Boulevard, Echo Station, Evergreen Circle, Amber Plaza, Moonlit Promenade, Cobalt Market, Duskwood Park, Riverstone Wharf, Lighthouse Point, Flare Alley and Horizon Mall. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Opal Theater has overlapping signal areas with Nimbus Plaza, Primrose Boulevard, Echo Station, Cobalt Market. \nThe Nimbus Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Evergreen Circle, Moonlit Promenade, Riverstone Wharf, Lighthouse Point, Horizon Mall. \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with Evergreen Circle, Cobalt Market, Duskwood Park, Lighthouse Point, Flare Alley. \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with Cobalt Market, Duskwood Park, Lighthouse Point. \nThe Evergreen Circle has overlapping signal areas with Cobalt Market, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Moonlit Promenade, Cobalt Market, Duskwood Park, Horizon Mall. \nThe Moonlit Promenade has overlapping signal areas with Cobalt Market, Duskwood Park, Flare Alley, Horizon Mall. \nThe Cobalt Market has overlapping signal areas with Riverstone Wharf, Lighthouse Point. \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Lighthouse Point, Flare Alley. \nThe Riverstone Wharf has overlapping signal areas with Flare Alley. \nThe Lighthouse Point has overlapping signal areas with Flare Alley. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference.

The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 13 major locations in the city: Jasper Marina, Quartz District, Haven Docks, Jade Fountain, Oakshade Library, Rosewood Hall, Beacon Tower, Sapphire Arena, Twilight Harbor, Pennywhistle Arcade, Nimbus Plaza, Copper Clock Square and Primrose Boulevard. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Jasper Marina has overlapping signal areas with Oakshade Library, Beacon Tower, Twilight Harbor, Copper Clock Square, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Haven Docks, Jade Fountain, Rosewood Hall, Beacon Tower, Sapphire Arena, Twilight Harbor, Pennywhistle Arcade, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Haven Docks has overlapping signal areas with Oakshade Library, Rosewood Hall, Twilight Harbor, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Jade Fountain has overlapping signal areas with Rosewood Hall. \nThe Oakshade Library has overlapping signal areas with Rosewood Hall, Beacon Tower, Twilight Harbor, Nimbus Plaza, Copper Clock Square, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Rosewood Hall has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena, Pennywhistle Arcade, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Twilight Harbor has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Nimbus Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Copper Clock Square. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 13 major locations in the city: Beacon Tower, Granite Plaza, Pennywhistle Arcade, Sapphire Arena, Knight’s Market, Riverstone Wharf, Velvet Corner, Opal Theater, Lighthouse Point, Maplewood Conservatory, King’s Row, Ivory Spire Cathedral and Quarry Point. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza, Pennywhistle Arcade, Velvet Corner, Opal Theater, Lighthouse Point, Maplewood Conservatory, King’s Row. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Knight’s Market, Riverstone Wharf, Velvet Corner, King’s Row, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena, Riverstone Wharf, Opal Theater, Lighthouse Point, King’s Row, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Quarry Point. \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with Lighthouse Point, Quarry Point. \nThe Knight’s Market has overlapping signal areas with Riverstone Wharf, Velvet Corner, Opal Theater, King’s Row. \nThe Riverstone Wharf has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater, Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Velvet Corner has overlapping signal areas with Lighthouse Point, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Quarry Point. \nThe Lighthouse Point has overlapping signal areas with Maplewood Conservatory, King’s Row. \nThe Maplewood Conservatory has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",
