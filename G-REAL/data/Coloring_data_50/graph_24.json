  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 24 major locations in the city: Horizon Mall, Beacon Tower, Primrose Boulevard, Velvet Corner, Gilded Archway, Azure Gardens, Sapphire Arena, Quarry Point, Amber Plaza, Riverstone Wharf, Ironbridge Crossing, Jasper Marina, Rosewood Hall, Duskwood Park, Lighthouse Point, King’s Row, Flint Forge Quarter, Pennywhistle Arcade, Westgate Station, Silvercrest Observatory, Echo Station, Flare Alley, Umbra Theater and Copper Clock Square. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower, Azure Gardens, Quarry Point, Riverstone Wharf, Jasper Marina, Lighthouse Point, King’s Row, Flint Forge Quarter, Pennywhistle Arcade, Westgate Station, Silvercrest Observatory, Echo Station. \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with Primrose Boulevard, Velvet Corner, Azure Gardens, Sapphire Arena, Quarry Point, Amber Plaza, Riverstone Wharf, Ironbridge Crossing, Duskwood Park, Silvercrest Observatory, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with Velvet Corner, Quarry Point, Amber Plaza, Ironbridge Crossing, Jasper Marina, Rosewood Hall, Umbra Theater. \nThe Velvet Corner has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena, Riverstone Wharf, Rosewood Hall, Lighthouse Point, Flint Forge Quarter, Silvercrest Observatory, Flare Alley, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Azure Gardens, Pennywhistle Arcade, Westgate Station, Silvercrest Observatory, Flare Alley, Umbra Theater. \nThe Azure Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena, Quarry Point, Riverstone Wharf, Ironbridge Crossing, Lighthouse Point, Flint Forge Quarter, Silvercrest Observatory, Echo Station, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with Riverstone Wharf, Ironbridge Crossing, King’s Row, Westgate Station, Echo Station, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Quarry Point has overlapping signal areas with Riverstone Wharf, Lighthouse Point, Pennywhistle Arcade, Silvercrest Observatory, Flare Alley. \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park, King’s Row, Pennywhistle Arcade, Westgate Station, Silvercrest Observatory, Echo Station, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Riverstone Wharf has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Silvercrest Observatory. \nThe Ironbridge Crossing has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina, Rosewood Hall, Flare Alley, Umbra Theater. \nThe Jasper Marina has overlapping signal areas with Rosewood Hall, Lighthouse Point, Flint Forge Quarter, Westgate Station, Silvercrest Observatory, Echo Station, Flare Alley, Umbra Theater. \nThe Rosewood Hall has overlapping signal areas with Lighthouse Point, Flint Forge Quarter, Westgate Station, Echo Station, Umbra Theater. \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Pennywhistle Arcade, Silvercrest Observatory, Flare Alley, Umbra Theater. \nThe Lighthouse Point has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Flint Forge Quarter, Silvercrest Observatory, Echo Station, Umbra Theater. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Flint Forge Quarter, Pennywhistle Arcade, Westgate Station, Flare Alley, Umbra Theater, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Westgate Station, Silvercrest Observatory, Echo Station, Flare Alley. \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Westgate Station, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station. \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater, Copper Clock Square. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 24 major locations in the city: Mosaic Plaza, Opal Theater, Skyline Gardens, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Yarrow Plaza, Union Square Market, Northwind Tower, Rosewood Hall, Ironbridge Crossing, Willowshade Pavilion, Riverstone Wharf, Jasper Marina, Jade Fountain, Duskwood Park, Amber Plaza, Beacon Tower, Sapphire Arena, King’s Row, Lunar Pier, Cobalt Market, Brass Lantern Tavern, Lighthouse Point, Umbra Theater and Primrose Boulevard. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Ironbridge Crossing, Jasper Marina, Sapphire Arena, Cobalt Market, Brass Lantern Tavern, Umbra Theater. \nThe Opal Theater has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens, Union Square Market, Rosewood Hall, Willowshade Pavilion, Duskwood Park, Beacon Tower, Sapphire Arena, King’s Row, Lunar Pier, Cobalt Market, Brass Lantern Tavern, Lighthouse Point, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Jasper Marina, Duskwood Park, Sapphire Arena, Lunar Pier, Cobalt Market, Brass Lantern Tavern, Lighthouse Point. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Union Square Market, Northwind Tower, Rosewood Hall, Ironbridge Crossing, Willowshade Pavilion, Riverstone Wharf, Amber Plaza, Sapphire Arena, Lighthouse Point, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Union Square Market, Riverstone Wharf, Jasper Marina, Jade Fountain, Cobalt Market, Brass Lantern Tavern, Lighthouse Point, Umbra Theater. \nThe Union Square Market has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Jasper Marina, Duskwood Park, Amber Plaza, King’s Row, Lighthouse Point. \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with Rosewood Hall, Beacon Tower, Lunar Pier, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Rosewood Hall has overlapping signal areas with Ironbridge Crossing, Willowshade Pavilion, Riverstone Wharf, Amber Plaza, Cobalt Market, Brass Lantern Tavern, Lighthouse Point, Umbra Theater. \nThe Ironbridge Crossing has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Jasper Marina, Amber Plaza, Beacon Tower, Sapphire Arena, Lunar Pier, Lighthouse Point, Umbra Theater. \nThe Willowshade Pavilion has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina, Jade Fountain, Beacon Tower, Sapphire Arena, King’s Row, Brass Lantern Tavern, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Riverstone Wharf has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina, Jade Fountain, Beacon Tower, Cobalt Market, Lighthouse Point. \nThe Jasper Marina has overlapping signal areas with Jade Fountain, Duskwood Park, Amber Plaza, Lunar Pier, Cobalt Market, Brass Lantern Tavern, Lighthouse Point, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Jade Fountain has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park, Beacon Tower, Lunar Pier. \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower, Sapphire Arena, King’s Row, Brass Lantern Tavern, Lighthouse Point, Umbra Theater, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Cobalt Market, Brass Lantern Tavern, Umbra Theater, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Lunar Pier has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Cobalt Market has overlapping signal areas with Lighthouse Point. \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with Primrose Boulevard. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 24 major locations in the city: Temple Square, Evergreen Circle, Azure Gardens, Echo Station, Maplewood Conservatory, Dragon’s Gate, Granite Plaza, Willowshade Pavilion, Zenith Arena, Sapphire Arena, Rosewood Hall, Shadowbridge Arcade, Jasper Marina, Flare Alley, Nimbus Plaza, Twilight Harbor, Silvercrest Observatory, Beacon Tower, Riverstone Wharf, Brass Lantern Tavern, Haven Docks, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Lighthouse Point and Mosaic Plaza. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Temple Square has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena, Rosewood Hall, Jasper Marina, Flare Alley, Silvercrest Observatory, Brass Lantern Tavern, Lighthouse Point, Mosaic Plaza. \nThe Evergreen Circle has overlapping signal areas with Dragon’s Gate, Willowshade Pavilion, Sapphire Arena, Flare Alley, Nimbus Plaza, Twilight Harbor, Silvercrest Observatory, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Mosaic Plaza. \nThe Azure Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade, Flare Alley, Twilight Harbor, Silvercrest Observatory, Lighthouse Point. \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with Rosewood Hall, Flare Alley, Twilight Harbor, Beacon Tower, Riverstone Wharf, Mosaic Plaza. \nThe Maplewood Conservatory has overlapping signal areas with Dragon’s Gate, Willowshade Pavilion, Zenith Arena, Shadowbridge Arcade, Twilight Harbor, Beacon Tower, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Lighthouse Point, Mosaic Plaza. \nThe Dragon’s Gate has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena, Rosewood Hall, Shadowbridge Arcade, Jasper Marina, Flare Alley, Riverstone Wharf, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Lighthouse Point, Mosaic Plaza. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Rosewood Hall, Shadowbridge Arcade, Jasper Marina, Flare Alley, Silvercrest Observatory, Riverstone Wharf, Mosaic Plaza. \nThe Willowshade Pavilion has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena, Rosewood Hall, Jasper Marina, Flare Alley, Nimbus Plaza, Twilight Harbor, Riverstone Wharf, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Zenith Arena has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena, Rosewood Hall, Shadowbridge Arcade, Jasper Marina, Flare Alley, Nimbus Plaza, Twilight Harbor, Brass Lantern Tavern, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade, Flare Alley, Twilight Harbor, Brass Lantern Tavern, Lighthouse Point. \nThe Rosewood Hall has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade, Flare Alley, Silvercrest Observatory, Beacon Tower, Haven Docks, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Lighthouse Point. \nThe Shadowbridge Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina, Nimbus Plaza, Twilight Harbor, Beacon Tower, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Jasper Marina has overlapping signal areas with Flare Alley, Twilight Harbor, Haven Docks, Lighthouse Point, Mosaic Plaza. \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Nimbus Plaza, Silvercrest Observatory, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Nimbus Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory, Beacon Tower, Riverstone Wharf, Lighthouse Point, Mosaic Plaza. \nThe Twilight Harbor has overlapping signal areas with Riverstone Wharf, Haven Docks. \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Mosaic Plaza. \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with Riverstone Wharf, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Lighthouse Point. \nThe Riverstone Wharf has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with Haven Docks, Mosaic Plaza. \nThe Haven Docks has overlapping signal areas with Lighthouse Point, Mosaic Plaza. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Lighthouse Point. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 24 major locations in the city: Silvercrest Observatory, Duskwood Park, Lunar Pier, Quarry Point, Lighthouse Point, Moonlit Promenade, Granite Plaza, Echo Station, Quartz District, Zenith Arena, Jasper Marina, Copper Clock Square, Flare Alley, Oakshade Library, Westgate Station, Velvet Corner, Amber Plaza, Sapphire Arena, Jade Fountain, Evergreen Circle, Northwind Tower, Dragon’s Gate, Willowshade Pavilion and Gilded Archway. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park, Lunar Pier, Lighthouse Point, Moonlit Promenade, Granite Plaza, Echo Station, Oakshade Library, Velvet Corner, Evergreen Circle, Dragon’s Gate, Willowshade Pavilion. \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier, Granite Plaza, Echo Station, Jasper Marina, Copper Clock Square, Evergreen Circle, Dragon’s Gate, Willowshade Pavilion. \nThe Lunar Pier has overlapping signal areas with Lighthouse Point, Granite Plaza, Quartz District, Oakshade Library, Westgate Station, Jade Fountain, Dragon’s Gate, Willowshade Pavilion. \nThe Quarry Point has overlapping signal areas with Moonlit Promenade, Granite Plaza, Echo Station, Quartz District, Zenith Arena, Jasper Marina, Copper Clock Square, Sapphire Arena, Jade Fountain, Northwind Tower, Dragon’s Gate, Willowshade Pavilion, Gilded Archway. \nThe Lighthouse Point has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza, Quartz District, Flare Alley, Amber Plaza, Sapphire Arena, Evergreen Circle, Gilded Archway. \nThe Moonlit Promenade has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza, Jasper Marina, Velvet Corner, Amber Plaza, Gilded Archway. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station, Zenith Arena, Jasper Marina, Copper Clock Square, Westgate Station, Velvet Corner, Amber Plaza, Sapphire Arena, Evergreen Circle, Dragon’s Gate. \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with Quartz District, Zenith Arena, Jasper Marina, Flare Alley, Jade Fountain, Northwind Tower, Dragon’s Gate, Willowshade Pavilion. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Copper Clock Square, Velvet Corner, Jade Fountain, Evergreen Circle, Northwind Tower. \nThe Zenith Arena has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina, Copper Clock Square, Oakshade Library, Westgate Station, Amber Plaza, Evergreen Circle, Dragon’s Gate. \nThe Jasper Marina has overlapping signal areas with Westgate Station, Velvet Corner, Jade Fountain, Northwind Tower. \nThe Copper Clock Square has overlapping signal areas with Westgate Station, Amber Plaza, Sapphire Arena, Dragon’s Gate, Gilded Archway. \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Oakshade Library, Jade Fountain, Willowshade Pavilion. \nThe Oakshade Library has overlapping signal areas with Velvet Corner, Sapphire Arena, Jade Fountain, Gilded Archway. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Velvet Corner, Dragon’s Gate. \nThe Velvet Corner has overlapping signal areas with Amber Plaza, Sapphire Arena, Jade Fountain, Evergreen Circle. \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Jade Fountain, Evergreen Circle. \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with Evergreen Circle, Dragon’s Gate, Willowshade Pavilion, Gilded Archway. \nThe Jade Fountain has overlapping signal areas with Evergreen Circle, Northwind Tower. \nThe Evergreen Circle has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Gilded Archway. \nThe Willowshade Pavilion has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 24 major locations in the city: King’s Row, Echo Station, Temple Square, Duskwood Park, Riverstone Wharf, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Quartz District, Moonlit Promenade, Flare Alley, Union Square Market, Silvercrest Observatory, Brass Lantern Tavern, Skyline Gardens, Flint Forge Quarter, Opal Theater, Northwind Tower, Willowshade Pavilion, Copper Clock Square, Oakshade Library, Jade Fountain, Shadowbridge Arcade, Knight’s Market, Beacon Tower and Quarry Point. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Quartz District, Flare Alley, Union Square Market, Skyline Gardens, Willowshade Pavilion, Oakshade Library, Jade Fountain, Shadowbridge Arcade, Knight’s Market, Beacon Tower, Quarry Point. \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with Temple Square, Riverstone Wharf, Opal Theater, Knight’s Market. \nThe Temple Square has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park, Riverstone Wharf, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Brass Lantern Tavern, Skyline Gardens, Oakshade Library, Jade Fountain, Shadowbridge Arcade, Quarry Point. \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Riverstone Wharf, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Moonlit Promenade, Union Square Market, Silvercrest Observatory, Brass Lantern Tavern, Opal Theater, Willowshade Pavilion, Oakshade Library, Quarry Point. \nThe Riverstone Wharf has overlapping signal areas with Union Square Market, Silvercrest Observatory, Brass Lantern Tavern, Skyline Gardens, Flint Forge Quarter, Opal Theater, Willowshade Pavilion, Oakshade Library, Knight’s Market, Beacon Tower. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory, Flint Forge Quarter, Opal Theater, Copper Clock Square, Oakshade Library, Shadowbridge Arcade, Beacon Tower, Quarry Point. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Flare Alley, Silvercrest Observatory, Skyline Gardens, Flint Forge Quarter, Copper Clock Square, Shadowbridge Arcade, Knight’s Market, Beacon Tower. \nThe Moonlit Promenade has overlapping signal areas with Flare Alley, Brass Lantern Tavern, Flint Forge Quarter, Willowshade Pavilion, Shadowbridge Arcade, Beacon Tower, Quarry Point. \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Union Square Market, Skyline Gardens, Opal Theater, Knight’s Market, Quarry Point. \nThe Union Square Market has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater, Willowshade Pavilion, Oakshade Library, Beacon Tower. \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Willowshade Pavilion, Shadowbridge Arcade, Knight’s Market, Quarry Point. \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens, Northwind Tower, Willowshade Pavilion, Shadowbridge Arcade, Knight’s Market. \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater, Beacon Tower, Quarry Point. \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, Copper Clock Square, Knight’s Market, Beacon Tower. \nThe Opal Theater has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Copper Clock Square, Jade Fountain, Shadowbridge Arcade, Quarry Point. \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade, Knight’s Market, Beacon Tower, Quarry Point. \nThe Willowshade Pavilion has overlapping signal areas with Copper Clock Square, Oakshade Library, Jade Fountain, Shadowbridge Arcade, Knight’s Market, Quarry Point. \nThe Copper Clock Square has overlapping signal areas with Oakshade Library, Knight’s Market, Quarry Point. \nThe Oakshade Library has overlapping signal areas with Jade Fountain, Shadowbridge Arcade. \nThe Jade Fountain has overlapping signal areas with Quarry Point. \nThe Knight’s Market has overlapping signal areas with Quarry Point. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 24 major locations in the city: Shadowbridge Arcade, Skyline Gardens, Riverstone Wharf, Knight’s Market, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Granite Plaza, Gilded Archway, Azure Gardens, Silvercrest Observatory, Yarrow Plaza, Haven Docks, Flint Forge Quarter, Duskwood Park, Horizon Mall, Maplewood Conservatory, Quartz District, Twilight Harbor, Rosewood Hall, Lighthouse Point, Temple Square, Amber Plaza, Westgate Station, Pennywhistle Arcade and Brass Lantern Tavern. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Shadowbridge Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens, Knight’s Market, Gilded Archway, Silvercrest Observatory, Yarrow Plaza, Duskwood Park, Quartz District, Twilight Harbor, Rosewood Hall, Lighthouse Point, Amber Plaza, Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Knight’s Market, Azure Gardens, Duskwood Park, Maplewood Conservatory, Quartz District, Twilight Harbor, Lighthouse Point, Temple Square, Amber Plaza, Westgate Station, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Riverstone Wharf has overlapping signal areas with Knight’s Market, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Gilded Archway, Azure Gardens, Horizon Mall, Lighthouse Point, Temple Square, Amber Plaza. \nThe Knight’s Market has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral, Silvercrest Observatory, Flint Forge Quarter, Maplewood Conservatory, Quartz District, Amber Plaza, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway, Yarrow Plaza, Flint Forge Quarter, Temple Square. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Azure Gardens, Yarrow Plaza, Haven Docks, Duskwood Park, Twilight Harbor, Temple Square, Amber Plaza. \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Azure Gardens, Flint Forge Quarter, Maplewood Conservatory, Rosewood Hall, Temple Square, Amber Plaza, Pennywhistle Arcade, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Azure Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory, Duskwood Park, Maplewood Conservatory, Twilight Harbor, Westgate Station, Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with Horizon Mall, Lighthouse Point, Pennywhistle Arcade, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Haven Docks, Flint Forge Quarter, Duskwood Park, Temple Square. \nThe Haven Docks has overlapping signal areas with Rosewood Hall, Lighthouse Point, Amber Plaza, Westgate Station. \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Maplewood Conservatory, Twilight Harbor, Rosewood Hall, Temple Square, Westgate Station, Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Quartz District, Twilight Harbor, Lighthouse Point, Amber Plaza, Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Maplewood Conservatory, Quartz District, Rosewood Hall, Temple Square, Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Maplewood Conservatory has overlapping signal areas with Quartz District, Twilight Harbor, Temple Square, Amber Plaza, Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Temple Square, Westgate Station, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Twilight Harbor has overlapping signal areas with Rosewood Hall, Lighthouse Point, Temple Square, Pennywhistle Arcade, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Rosewood Hall has overlapping signal areas with Lighthouse Point, Amber Plaza. \nThe Lighthouse Point has overlapping signal areas with Temple Square, Amber Plaza, Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Temple Square has overlapping signal areas with Amber Plaza, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 24 major locations in the city: Granite Plaza, Rosewood Hall, Nimbus Plaza, Ironbridge Crossing, Willowshade Pavilion, Umbra Theater, Beacon Tower, Quarry Point, Flint Forge Quarter, Haven Docks, Knight’s Market, Sapphire Arena, Amber Plaza, Lighthouse Point, Westgate Station, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Brass Lantern Tavern, Jasper Marina, Azure Gardens, Shadowbridge Arcade, Copper Clock Square, Echo Station, Union Square Market and Pennywhistle Arcade. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Rosewood Hall, Willowshade Pavilion, Quarry Point, Haven Docks, Jasper Marina, Azure Gardens, Echo Station. \nThe Rosewood Hall has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower, Haven Docks, Sapphire Arena, Lighthouse Point, Jasper Marina, Shadowbridge Arcade, Union Square Market, Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Nimbus Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Ironbridge Crossing, Quarry Point, Haven Docks, Amber Plaza, Lighthouse Point, Brass Lantern Tavern, Azure Gardens, Shadowbridge Arcade, Union Square Market. \nThe Ironbridge Crossing has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower, Quarry Point, Flint Forge Quarter, Knight’s Market, Sapphire Arena, Amber Plaza, Lighthouse Point, Westgate Station, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Jasper Marina, Copper Clock Square, Echo Station, Union Square Market, Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Willowshade Pavilion has overlapping signal areas with Quarry Point, Flint Forge Quarter, Lighthouse Point, Westgate Station, Echo Station, Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Umbra Theater has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower, Flint Forge Quarter, Haven Docks, Sapphire Arena, Lighthouse Point, Westgate Station, Brass Lantern Tavern, Shadowbridge Arcade, Echo Station. \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with Quarry Point, Flint Forge Quarter, Brass Lantern Tavern, Shadowbridge Arcade, Copper Clock Square, Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Quarry Point has overlapping signal areas with Flint Forge Quarter, Brass Lantern Tavern, Echo Station, Union Square Market. \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Knight’s Market, Shadowbridge Arcade, Echo Station, Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Haven Docks has overlapping signal areas with Knight’s Market, Amber Plaza, Lighthouse Point, Brass Lantern Tavern, Jasper Marina, Azure Gardens, Shadowbridge Arcade, Union Square Market. \nThe Knight’s Market has overlapping signal areas with Amber Plaza, Lighthouse Point, Westgate Station, Copper Clock Square, Echo Station, Union Square Market. \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral, Brass Lantern Tavern, Jasper Marina, Azure Gardens, Shadowbridge Arcade, Copper Clock Square, Echo Station, Union Square Market, Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral, Copper Clock Square, Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Lighthouse Point has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral, Jasper Marina, Shadowbridge Arcade. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade, Echo Station. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina, Azure Gardens, Shadowbridge Arcade, Copper Clock Square, Echo Station. \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade, Echo Station. \nThe Jasper Marina has overlapping signal areas with Azure Gardens, Echo Station, Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Azure Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade, Echo Station, Union Square Market. \nThe Shadowbridge Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Copper Clock Square, Echo Station. \nThe Copper Clock Square has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with Union Square Market. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 24 major locations in the city: Jade Fountain, Gilded Archway, Riverstone Wharf, Evergreen Circle, Lunar Pier, Quartz District, Rosewood Hall, Primrose Boulevard, Pennywhistle Arcade, Lighthouse Point, Flint Forge Quarter, Echo Station, Silvercrest Observatory, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Amber Plaza, Skyline Gardens, Nimbus Plaza, Ironbridge Crossing, Cobalt Market, Opal Theater, Moonlit Promenade, Copper Clock Square, Westgate Station and Maplewood Conservatory. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Jade Fountain has overlapping signal areas with Evergreen Circle, Primrose Boulevard, Echo Station, Silvercrest Observatory, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Amber Plaza, Ironbridge Crossing, Cobalt Market, Opal Theater, Copper Clock Square, Westgate Station, Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Quartz District, Rosewood Hall, Primrose Boulevard, Silvercrest Observatory, Ironbridge Crossing. \nThe Riverstone Wharf has overlapping signal areas with Evergreen Circle, Lunar Pier, Lighthouse Point, Flint Forge Quarter, Echo Station, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Amber Plaza, Nimbus Plaza, Cobalt Market. \nThe Evergreen Circle has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier, Rosewood Hall, Primrose Boulevard, Lighthouse Point, Silvercrest Observatory, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Amber Plaza, Opal Theater, Copper Clock Square, Westgate Station. \nThe Lunar Pier has overlapping signal areas with Quartz District, Pennywhistle Arcade, Lighthouse Point, Flint Forge Quarter, Echo Station, Silvercrest Observatory, Ironbridge Crossing, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Lighthouse Point, Flint Forge Quarter, Silvercrest Observatory, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Amber Plaza, Skyline Gardens, Ironbridge Crossing, Cobalt Market, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Rosewood Hall has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade, Lighthouse Point, Flint Forge Quarter, Echo Station, Amber Plaza, Opal Theater, Moonlit Promenade, Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with Flint Forge Quarter, Echo Station, Cobalt Market, Opal Theater. \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Lighthouse Point, Flint Forge Quarter, Silvercrest Observatory, Amber Plaza, Nimbus Plaza, Ironbridge Crossing, Moonlit Promenade, Westgate Station. \nThe Lighthouse Point has overlapping signal areas with Flint Forge Quarter, Skyline Gardens, Moonlit Promenade, Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens, Ironbridge Crossing, Westgate Station. \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Amber Plaza, Skyline Gardens, Ironbridge Crossing, Westgate Station. \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens, Cobalt Market, Copper Clock Square, Westgate Station, Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens, Nimbus Plaza, Cobalt Market, Opal Theater, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Nimbus Plaza, Cobalt Market. \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Cobalt Market, Moonlit Promenade, Westgate Station, Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Nimbus Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Ironbridge Crossing, Opal Theater, Moonlit Promenade, Copper Clock Square, Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Ironbridge Crossing has overlapping signal areas with Cobalt Market, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Cobalt Market has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater, Westgate Station. \nThe Opal Theater has overlapping signal areas with Moonlit Promenade, Copper Clock Square, Westgate Station. \nThe Copper Clock Square has overlapping signal areas with Maplewood Conservatory. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 24 major locations in the city: Dragon’s Gate, Twilight Harbor, Mosaic Plaza, Shadowbridge Arcade, Pennywhistle Arcade, Umbra Theater, Jade Fountain, King’s Row, Skyline Gardens, Copper Clock Square, Knight’s Market, Lighthouse Point, Lunar Pier, Quartz District, Riverstone Wharf, Granite Plaza, Nimbus Plaza, Evergreen Circle, Duskwood Park, Ironbridge Crossing, Quarry Point, Zenith Arena, Willowshade Pavilion and Cobalt Market. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Dragon’s Gate has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Knight’s Market, Lunar Pier, Quartz District, Riverstone Wharf, Granite Plaza, Nimbus Plaza, Evergreen Circle, Cobalt Market. \nThe Twilight Harbor has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade, Umbra Theater, King’s Row, Skyline Gardens, Lunar Pier, Quartz District, Granite Plaza, Nimbus Plaza, Evergreen Circle, Duskwood Park, Ironbridge Crossing, Quarry Point, Zenith Arena, Willowshade Pavilion, Cobalt Market. \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens, Quartz District, Riverstone Wharf, Granite Plaza, Evergreen Circle, Quarry Point, Cobalt Market. \nThe Shadowbridge Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens, Knight’s Market, Granite Plaza, Ironbridge Crossing, Willowshade Pavilion, Cobalt Market. \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens, Lighthouse Point, Quartz District, Riverstone Wharf, Granite Plaza, Duskwood Park, Ironbridge Crossing, Zenith Arena, Cobalt Market. \nThe Umbra Theater has overlapping signal areas with Jade Fountain, King’s Row, Knight’s Market, Lighthouse Point, Lunar Pier, Granite Plaza, Zenith Arena, Cobalt Market. \nThe Jade Fountain has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens, Copper Clock Square, Lighthouse Point, Quartz District, Riverstone Wharf, Nimbus Plaza, Duskwood Park, Ironbridge Crossing, Willowshade Pavilion, Cobalt Market. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Lighthouse Point, Evergreen Circle, Duskwood Park, Ironbridge Crossing. \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Copper Clock Square, Lighthouse Point, Lunar Pier, Riverstone Wharf, Granite Plaza, Nimbus Plaza, Duskwood Park. \nThe Copper Clock Square has overlapping signal areas with Lighthouse Point, Quartz District, Riverstone Wharf, Granite Plaza, Willowshade Pavilion, Cobalt Market. \nThe Knight’s Market has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier, Quartz District, Ironbridge Crossing, Zenith Arena, Willowshade Pavilion, Cobalt Market. \nThe Lighthouse Point has overlapping signal areas with Quartz District, Quarry Point, Cobalt Market. \nThe Lunar Pier has overlapping signal areas with Quartz District, Duskwood Park, Quarry Point, Zenith Arena. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Ironbridge Crossing, Quarry Point, Willowshade Pavilion. \nThe Riverstone Wharf has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park, Quarry Point, Zenith Arena. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Nimbus Plaza, Zenith Arena, Willowshade Pavilion. \nThe Nimbus Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Evergreen Circle, Ironbridge Crossing, Willowshade Pavilion. \nThe Evergreen Circle has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park, Ironbridge Crossing, Zenith Arena. \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Zenith Arena, Willowshade Pavilion, Cobalt Market. \nThe Ironbridge Crossing has overlapping signal areas with Cobalt Market. \nThe Quarry Point has overlapping signal areas with Zenith Arena. \nThe Zenith Arena has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 24 major locations in the city: Evergreen Circle, Skyline Gardens, Union Square Market, Zenith Arena, Primrose Boulevard, King’s Row, Ironbridge Crossing, Brass Lantern Tavern, Pennywhistle Arcade, Haven Docks, Oakshade Library, Willowshade Pavilion, Quarry Point, Riverstone Wharf, Sapphire Arena, Umbra Theater, Shadowbridge Arcade, Rosewood Hall, Copper Clock Square, Flare Alley, Northwind Tower, Duskwood Park, Beacon Tower and Granite Plaza. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Evergreen Circle has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Ironbridge Crossing, Willowshade Pavilion, Sapphire Arena, Umbra Theater, Copper Clock Square, Northwind Tower, Duskwood Park, Granite Plaza. \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Zenith Arena, Primrose Boulevard, King’s Row, Ironbridge Crossing, Willowshade Pavilion, Umbra Theater, Shadowbridge Arcade, Rosewood Hall, Copper Clock Square, Northwind Tower, Duskwood Park, Granite Plaza. \nThe Union Square Market has overlapping signal areas with Zenith Arena, Primrose Boulevard, Brass Lantern Tavern, Haven Docks, Willowshade Pavilion, Riverstone Wharf, Sapphire Arena, Shadowbridge Arcade, Northwind Tower. \nThe Zenith Arena has overlapping signal areas with Primrose Boulevard, King’s Row, Brass Lantern Tavern, Pennywhistle Arcade, Sapphire Arena, Copper Clock Square, Duskwood Park. \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with Haven Docks, Sapphire Arena, Duskwood Park, Beacon Tower, Granite Plaza. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena, Umbra Theater, Shadowbridge Arcade, Rosewood Hall, Copper Clock Square, Flare Alley, Duskwood Park, Granite Plaza. \nThe Ironbridge Crossing has overlapping signal areas with Oakshade Library, Willowshade Pavilion, Rosewood Hall, Granite Plaza. \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with Quarry Point, Umbra Theater, Shadowbridge Arcade, Flare Alley, Beacon Tower. \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Oakshade Library, Willowshade Pavilion, Rosewood Hall, Flare Alley, Beacon Tower, Granite Plaza. \nThe Haven Docks has overlapping signal areas with Quarry Point, Shadowbridge Arcade, Flare Alley, Northwind Tower, Granite Plaza. \nThe Oakshade Library has overlapping signal areas with Quarry Point, Riverstone Wharf, Umbra Theater, Copper Clock Square, Flare Alley, Duskwood Park, Granite Plaza. \nThe Willowshade Pavilion has overlapping signal areas with Quarry Point, Riverstone Wharf, Sapphire Arena, Shadowbridge Arcade, Northwind Tower, Beacon Tower. \nThe Quarry Point has overlapping signal areas with Riverstone Wharf, Sapphire Arena, Umbra Theater, Shadowbridge Arcade, Rosewood Hall, Copper Clock Square, Northwind Tower, Duskwood Park. \nThe Riverstone Wharf has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena, Flare Alley, Northwind Tower. \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater, Copper Clock Square, Flare Alley. \nThe Umbra Theater has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade, Northwind Tower. \nThe Shadowbridge Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Rosewood Hall, Copper Clock Square, Northwind Tower, Duskwood Park. \nThe Rosewood Hall has overlapping signal areas with Flare Alley, Northwind Tower, Duskwood Park, Granite Plaza. \nThe Copper Clock Square has overlapping signal areas with Flare Alley, Northwind Tower. \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, Duskwood Park, Beacon Tower. \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park, Granite Plaza. \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 24 major locations in the city: Rosewood Hall, Zenith Arena, Duskwood Park, Lighthouse Point, Riverstone Wharf, Gilded Archway, Ironbridge Crossing, Mosaic Plaza, Primrose Boulevard, Flare Alley, Azure Gardens, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Horizon Mall, Oakshade Library, Northwind Tower, Jasper Marina, Dragon’s Gate, Echo Station, Umbra Theater, Skyline Gardens, Nimbus Plaza, Moonlit Promenade, Flint Forge Quarter and King’s Row. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Rosewood Hall has overlapping signal areas with Primrose Boulevard, Azure Gardens, Northwind Tower, Umbra Theater, Nimbus Plaza. \nThe Zenith Arena has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park, Lighthouse Point, Gilded Archway, Primrose Boulevard, Flare Alley, Northwind Tower, Jasper Marina, Dragon’s Gate, Umbra Theater, Skyline Gardens, Moonlit Promenade, King’s Row. \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Lighthouse Point, Riverstone Wharf, Ironbridge Crossing, Mosaic Plaza, Azure Gardens, Horizon Mall, Oakshade Library, Umbra Theater, Skyline Gardens, Nimbus Plaza, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Lighthouse Point has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway, Ironbridge Crossing, Mosaic Plaza, Oakshade Library, Northwind Tower, Jasper Marina, Dragon’s Gate, Flint Forge Quarter. \nThe Riverstone Wharf has overlapping signal areas with Primrose Boulevard, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Horizon Mall, Northwind Tower, Jasper Marina, Nimbus Plaza. \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza, Primrose Boulevard, Flare Alley, Azure Gardens, Northwind Tower, Jasper Marina, Echo Station, Nimbus Plaza, Flint Forge Quarter, King’s Row. \nThe Ironbridge Crossing has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza, Flare Alley, Azure Gardens, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Horizon Mall, Oakshade Library, Nimbus Plaza, Moonlit Promenade, Flint Forge Quarter. \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Primrose Boulevard, Flare Alley, Horizon Mall, Northwind Tower, Umbra Theater, Moonlit Promenade, King’s Row. \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with Flare Alley, Azure Gardens, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Horizon Mall, Umbra Theater, Skyline Gardens, Moonlit Promenade, Flint Forge Quarter. \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral, Horizon Mall, Echo Station, Umbra Theater, Skyline Gardens. \nThe Azure Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral, Jasper Marina, Umbra Theater, Skyline Gardens, Flint Forge Quarter, King’s Row. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina, Umbra Theater, Flint Forge Quarter. \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, Dragon’s Gate, Echo Station, King’s Row. \nThe Oakshade Library has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, Skyline Gardens, Flint Forge Quarter. \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina, Echo Station, Moonlit Promenade, King’s Row. \nThe Jasper Marina has overlapping signal areas with Dragon’s Gate, Umbra Theater. \nThe Dragon’s Gate has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater, Nimbus Plaza, Moonlit Promenade, King’s Row. \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater, Nimbus Plaza, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Umbra Theater has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens, Nimbus Plaza, King’s Row. \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Nimbus Plaza. \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 24 major locations in the city: Jade Fountain, Union Square Market, Shadowbridge Arcade, Willowshade Pavilion, Jasper Marina, Riverstone Wharf, Nimbus Plaza, King’s Row, Dragon’s Gate, Velvet Corner, Pennywhistle Arcade, Northwind Tower, Duskwood Park, Echo Station, Amber Plaza, Horizon Mall, Yarrow Plaza, Flare Alley, Granite Plaza, Copper Clock Square, Zenith Arena, Knight’s Market, Skyline Gardens and Sapphire Arena. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Jade Fountain has overlapping signal areas with Union Square Market, Nimbus Plaza, King’s Row, Echo Station, Flare Alley, Granite Plaza, Sapphire Arena. \nThe Union Square Market has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Jasper Marina, Riverstone Wharf, Nimbus Plaza, King’s Row, Velvet Corner, Horizon Mall, Yarrow Plaza, Knight’s Market, Sapphire Arena. \nThe Shadowbridge Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Jasper Marina, Pennywhistle Arcade, Duskwood Park, Amber Plaza, Horizon Mall, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Willowshade Pavilion has overlapping signal areas with Velvet Corner, Echo Station, Horizon Mall, Copper Clock Square, Zenith Arena, Knight’s Market. \nThe Jasper Marina has overlapping signal areas with Riverstone Wharf, King’s Row, Dragon’s Gate, Pennywhistle Arcade, Horizon Mall, Yarrow Plaza, Flare Alley, Granite Plaza, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Riverstone Wharf has overlapping signal areas with Nimbus Plaza, Dragon’s Gate, Velvet Corner, Pennywhistle Arcade, Duskwood Park, Echo Station, Amber Plaza, Horizon Mall, Granite Plaza, Copper Clock Square, Knight’s Market, Skyline Gardens. \nThe Nimbus Plaza has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Dragon’s Gate, Pennywhistle Arcade, Horizon Mall, Zenith Arena, Knight’s Market. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Dragon’s Gate, Pennywhistle Arcade, Echo Station, Horizon Mall, Yarrow Plaza, Flare Alley, Knight’s Market, Skyline Gardens, Sapphire Arena. \nThe Dragon’s Gate has overlapping signal areas with Velvet Corner, Pennywhistle Arcade, Horizon Mall, Yarrow Plaza, Flare Alley, Zenith Arena, Knight’s Market, Sapphire Arena. \nThe Velvet Corner has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, Duskwood Park, Zenith Arena, Skyline Gardens. \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, Echo Station, Granite Plaza, Skyline Gardens. \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station, Horizon Mall, Copper Clock Square, Knight’s Market, Sapphire Arena. \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Amber Plaza, Horizon Mall, Yarrow Plaza, Copper Clock Square, Skyline Gardens. \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with Horizon Mall, Yarrow Plaza, Flare Alley, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, Granite Plaza, Copper Clock Square, Knight’s Market. \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Copper Clock Square, Zenith Arena. \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Flare Alley, Zenith Arena, Knight’s Market. \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza, Zenith Arena, Skyline Gardens. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Knight’s Market. \nThe Copper Clock Square has overlapping signal areas with Zenith Arena, Knight’s Market, Skyline Gardens. \nThe Zenith Arena has overlapping signal areas with Knight’s Market, Skyline Gardens. \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 24 major locations in the city: Union Square Market, Flint Forge Quarter, Knight’s Market, King’s Row, Ironbridge Crossing, Riverstone Wharf, Beacon Tower, Evergreen Circle, Umbra Theater, Nimbus Plaza, Cobalt Market, Oakshade Library, Jade Fountain, Amber Plaza, Velvet Corner, Quarry Point, Zenith Arena, Horizon Mall, Dragon’s Gate, Jasper Marina, Duskwood Park, Yarrow Plaza, Azure Gardens and Twilight Harbor. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Union Square Market has overlapping signal areas with Flint Forge Quarter, Knight’s Market, Riverstone Wharf, Beacon Tower, Evergreen Circle, Oakshade Library, Amber Plaza, Velvet Corner, Zenith Arena, Dragon’s Gate, Duskwood Park. \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Ironbridge Crossing, Riverstone Wharf, Beacon Tower, Evergreen Circle, Umbra Theater, Amber Plaza, Zenith Arena, Horizon Mall, Yarrow Plaza. \nThe Knight’s Market has overlapping signal areas with Ironbridge Crossing, Beacon Tower, Nimbus Plaza, Amber Plaza, Velvet Corner, Duskwood Park, Yarrow Plaza. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater, Oakshade Library, Quarry Point, Zenith Arena, Twilight Harbor. \nThe Ironbridge Crossing has overlapping signal areas with Cobalt Market, Oakshade Library, Jade Fountain, Amber Plaza, Duskwood Park, Twilight Harbor. \nThe Riverstone Wharf has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower, Evergreen Circle, Umbra Theater, Nimbus Plaza, Cobalt Market, Oakshade Library, Amber Plaza, Velvet Corner, Quarry Point, Horizon Mall, Jasper Marina, Yarrow Plaza, Twilight Harbor. \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with Nimbus Plaza, Oakshade Library, Velvet Corner, Quarry Point, Zenith Arena, Horizon Mall, Dragon’s Gate, Azure Gardens, Twilight Harbor. \nThe Evergreen Circle has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater, Cobalt Market, Horizon Mall, Yarrow Plaza, Twilight Harbor. \nThe Umbra Theater has overlapping signal areas with Oakshade Library, Velvet Corner, Quarry Point, Dragon’s Gate, Jasper Marina, Azure Gardens. \nThe Nimbus Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Oakshade Library, Velvet Corner, Quarry Point, Zenith Arena, Horizon Mall, Dragon’s Gate, Jasper Marina, Duskwood Park, Yarrow Plaza, Twilight Harbor. \nThe Cobalt Market has overlapping signal areas with Amber Plaza, Velvet Corner. \nThe Oakshade Library has overlapping signal areas with Velvet Corner, Dragon’s Gate, Duskwood Park, Azure Gardens. \nThe Jade Fountain has overlapping signal areas with Dragon’s Gate, Duskwood Park. \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Velvet Corner, Quarry Point, Dragon’s Gate, Duskwood Park, Azure Gardens. \nThe Velvet Corner has overlapping signal areas with Horizon Mall, Jasper Marina, Azure Gardens. \nThe Quarry Point has overlapping signal areas with Zenith Arena, Horizon Mall, Dragon’s Gate, Yarrow Plaza. \nThe Zenith Arena has overlapping signal areas with Horizon Mall, Jasper Marina, Yarrow Plaza. \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Dragon’s Gate, Jasper Marina, Duskwood Park. \nThe Dragon’s Gate has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina. \nThe Jasper Marina has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, Azure Gardens, Twilight Harbor. \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, Azure Gardens, Twilight Harbor. \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Azure Gardens. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 24 major locations in the city: Temple Square, Moonlit Promenade, Duskwood Park, Northwind Tower, Evergreen Circle, Shadowbridge Arcade, Horizon Mall, Dragon’s Gate, Echo Station, Quarry Point, King’s Row, Primrose Boulevard, Opal Theater, Skyline Gardens, Flint Forge Quarter, Pennywhistle Arcade, Yarrow Plaza, Jasper Marina, Union Square Market, Sapphire Arena, Quartz District, Nimbus Plaza, Westgate Station and Rosewood Hall. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Temple Square has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, Evergreen Circle, Dragon’s Gate, Primrose Boulevard, Skyline Gardens, Flint Forge Quarter, Jasper Marina, Union Square Market, Sapphire Arena, Westgate Station, Rosewood Hall. \nThe Moonlit Promenade has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park, Evergreen Circle, Dragon’s Gate, King’s Row, Skyline Gardens, Yarrow Plaza, Jasper Marina, Rosewood Hall. \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, Echo Station, Primrose Boulevard, Opal Theater, Flint Forge Quarter, Pennywhistle Arcade, Union Square Market, Westgate Station, Rosewood Hall. \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with Dragon’s Gate, Primrose Boulevard, Opal Theater, Skyline Gardens, Flint Forge Quarter, Pennywhistle Arcade, Yarrow Plaza, Jasper Marina, Union Square Market, Nimbus Plaza, Westgate Station. \nThe Evergreen Circle has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade, Dragon’s Gate, Echo Station, King’s Row, Skyline Gardens, Pennywhistle Arcade, Union Square Market, Rosewood Hall. \nThe Shadowbridge Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Dragon’s Gate, Echo Station, Quarry Point, Opal Theater, Flint Forge Quarter, Union Square Market. \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Primrose Boulevard, Flint Forge Quarter, Pennywhistle Arcade, Sapphire Arena, Quartz District, Nimbus Plaza, Rosewood Hall. \nThe Dragon’s Gate has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station, Quarry Point, Primrose Boulevard, Opal Theater, Skyline Gardens, Jasper Marina, Quartz District, Rosewood Hall. \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with Quarry Point, Primrose Boulevard, Opal Theater, Skyline Gardens, Flint Forge Quarter, Yarrow Plaza, Westgate Station, Rosewood Hall. \nThe Quarry Point has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Primrose Boulevard, Opal Theater, Union Square Market, Quartz District, Nimbus Plaza. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens, Union Square Market, Westgate Station. \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater, Yarrow Plaza, Rosewood Hall. \nThe Opal Theater has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade, Yarrow Plaza, Sapphire Arena, Westgate Station. \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina. \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, Jasper Marina, Union Square Market, Rosewood Hall. \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, Union Square Market, Quartz District. \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena, Quartz District, Nimbus Plaza, Westgate Station, Rosewood Hall. \nThe Jasper Marina has overlapping signal areas with Union Square Market, Westgate Station, Rosewood Hall. \nThe Union Square Market has overlapping signal areas with Quartz District, Nimbus Plaza. \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with Nimbus Plaza. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Nimbus Plaza, Rosewood Hall. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Rosewood Hall. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 24 major locations in the city: Mosaic Plaza, Azure Gardens, Ironbridge Crossing, Twilight Harbor, Amber Plaza, Lunar Pier, Yarrow Plaza, Knight’s Market, Horizon Mall, Duskwood Park, Lighthouse Point, Silvercrest Observatory, Flare Alley, Maplewood Conservatory, Gilded Archway, Jasper Marina, Brass Lantern Tavern, Pennywhistle Arcade, Granite Plaza, Opal Theater, Rosewood Hall, Dragon’s Gate, Evergreen Circle and Copper Clock Square. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Lighthouse Point, Gilded Archway, Opal Theater, Dragon’s Gate, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Azure Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Twilight Harbor, Amber Plaza, Yarrow Plaza, Horizon Mall, Lighthouse Point, Flare Alley, Maplewood Conservatory, Gilded Archway, Pennywhistle Arcade, Granite Plaza, Opal Theater, Dragon’s Gate, Evergreen Circle, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Ironbridge Crossing has overlapping signal areas with Amber Plaza, Yarrow Plaza, Knight’s Market, Flare Alley, Dragon’s Gate. \nThe Twilight Harbor has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier, Yarrow Plaza, Knight’s Market, Duskwood Park, Lighthouse Point, Silvercrest Observatory, Maplewood Conservatory, Gilded Archway, Pennywhistle Arcade, Rosewood Hall, Evergreen Circle. \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier, Yarrow Plaza, Lighthouse Point, Silvercrest Observatory, Flare Alley, Gilded Archway, Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Lunar Pier has overlapping signal areas with Knight’s Market, Silvercrest Observatory, Jasper Marina, Brass Lantern Tavern, Granite Plaza, Evergreen Circle, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park, Lighthouse Point, Flare Alley, Brass Lantern Tavern, Opal Theater, Evergreen Circle. \nThe Knight’s Market has overlapping signal areas with Horizon Mall, Lighthouse Point, Silvercrest Observatory, Flare Alley, Gilded Archway, Jasper Marina, Brass Lantern Tavern, Granite Plaza, Opal Theater. \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Lighthouse Point, Flare Alley, Maplewood Conservatory, Gilded Archway, Brass Lantern Tavern, Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Flare Alley, Maplewood Conservatory, Pennywhistle Arcade, Opal Theater, Dragon’s Gate. \nThe Lighthouse Point has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory, Maplewood Conservatory, Gilded Archway, Brass Lantern Tavern, Pennywhistle Arcade, Dragon’s Gate. \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway, Pennywhistle Arcade, Dragon’s Gate, Evergreen Circle. \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina, Opal Theater, Dragon’s Gate. \nThe Maplewood Conservatory has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway, Brass Lantern Tavern, Pennywhistle Arcade, Opal Theater, Rosewood Hall, Dragon’s Gate. \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina, Granite Plaza, Rosewood Hall, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Jasper Marina has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Granite Plaza, Opal Theater, Dragon’s Gate. \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade, Opal Theater, Evergreen Circle, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Rosewood Hall. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Evergreen Circle. \nThe Opal Theater has overlapping signal areas with Rosewood Hall, Dragon’s Gate, Evergreen Circle. \nThe Rosewood Hall has overlapping signal areas with Dragon’s Gate, Evergreen Circle, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Dragon’s Gate has overlapping signal areas with Evergreen Circle. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 24 major locations in the city: Yarrow Plaza, Evergreen Circle, Umbra Theater, Brass Lantern Tavern, Northwind Tower, Flint Forge Quarter, Westgate Station, Quarry Point, Skyline Gardens, Temple Square, Echo Station, Azure Gardens, Lunar Pier, Jasper Marina, Silvercrest Observatory, Flare Alley, Beacon Tower, Opal Theater, Moonlit Promenade, Mosaic Plaza, Rosewood Hall, Haven Docks, Twilight Harbor and Ironbridge Crossing. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Northwind Tower, Flint Forge Quarter, Quarry Point, Temple Square, Lunar Pier, Jasper Marina, Flare Alley, Opal Theater. \nThe Evergreen Circle has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater, Brass Lantern Tavern, Flint Forge Quarter, Quarry Point, Echo Station, Lunar Pier, Flare Alley, Haven Docks. \nThe Umbra Theater has overlapping signal areas with Flint Forge Quarter, Westgate Station, Quarry Point, Skyline Gardens, Temple Square, Lunar Pier, Jasper Marina, Flare Alley, Opal Theater, Moonlit Promenade, Ironbridge Crossing. \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with Flint Forge Quarter, Westgate Station, Temple Square, Echo Station, Lunar Pier, Moonlit Promenade, Twilight Harbor, Ironbridge Crossing. \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with Flint Forge Quarter, Quarry Point, Skyline Gardens, Temple Square, Jasper Marina, Silvercrest Observatory, Flare Alley, Opal Theater, Mosaic Plaza, Haven Docks, Twilight Harbor. \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Quarry Point, Skyline Gardens, Echo Station, Silvercrest Observatory, Rosewood Hall, Haven Docks. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Quarry Point, Temple Square, Echo Station, Azure Gardens, Silvercrest Observatory, Beacon Tower, Moonlit Promenade, Mosaic Plaza, Twilight Harbor. \nThe Quarry Point has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens, Echo Station, Ironbridge Crossing. \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier, Twilight Harbor. \nThe Temple Square has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station, Lunar Pier, Beacon Tower, Opal Theater, Moonlit Promenade, Haven Docks. \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with Azure Gardens, Flare Alley, Beacon Tower, Opal Theater, Rosewood Hall, Twilight Harbor, Ironbridge Crossing. \nThe Azure Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier, Silvercrest Observatory, Flare Alley, Opal Theater, Moonlit Promenade, Mosaic Plaza, Rosewood Hall, Twilight Harbor. \nThe Lunar Pier has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory, Mosaic Plaza, Rosewood Hall, Twilight Harbor. \nThe Jasper Marina has overlapping signal areas with Moonlit Promenade, Mosaic Plaza. \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with Moonlit Promenade, Mosaic Plaza, Haven Docks, Ironbridge Crossing. \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower, Moonlit Promenade, Mosaic Plaza, Rosewood Hall. \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with Haven Docks, Ironbridge Crossing. \nThe Opal Theater has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza, Haven Docks, Ironbridge Crossing. \nThe Moonlit Promenade has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza, Rosewood Hall, Ironbridge Crossing. \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Rosewood Hall, Ironbridge Crossing. \nThe Rosewood Hall has overlapping signal areas with Ironbridge Crossing. \nThe Haven Docks has overlapping signal areas with Twilight Harbor. \nThe Twilight Harbor has overlapping signal areas with Ironbridge Crossing. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 24 major locations in the city: Beacon Tower, Silvercrest Observatory, Lunar Pier, Jade Fountain, Opal Theater, Skyline Gardens, Azure Gardens, Northwind Tower, Duskwood Park, Umbra Theater, Copper Clock Square, Horizon Mall, Nimbus Plaza, Amber Plaza, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Westgate Station, Moonlit Promenade, Union Square Market, Rosewood Hall, Knight’s Market, Evergreen Circle, Quarry Point, Jasper Marina and Brass Lantern Tavern. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory, Nimbus Plaza, Amber Plaza, Westgate Station, Union Square Market, Rosewood Hall, Knight’s Market. \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with Jade Fountain, Skyline Gardens, Duskwood Park, Umbra Theater, Rosewood Hall, Knight’s Market, Evergreen Circle, Quarry Point, Jasper Marina, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Lunar Pier has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater, Skyline Gardens, Northwind Tower, Duskwood Park, Umbra Theater, Nimbus Plaza, Knight’s Market, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Jade Fountain has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater, Skyline Gardens, Duskwood Park, Umbra Theater, Copper Clock Square, Horizon Mall, Nimbus Plaza, Union Square Market, Rosewood Hall, Evergreen Circle, Quarry Point. \nThe Opal Theater has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater, Nimbus Plaza, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Westgate Station, Moonlit Promenade, Rosewood Hall, Knight’s Market, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Azure Gardens, Westgate Station, Rosewood Hall, Quarry Point, Jasper Marina, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Azure Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, Duskwood Park, Umbra Theater, Copper Clock Square, Horizon Mall, Amber Plaza, Westgate Station, Quarry Point, Jasper Marina. \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Moonlit Promenade, Union Square Market, Jasper Marina. \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater, Amber Plaza, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Knight’s Market, Evergreen Circle, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Umbra Theater has overlapping signal areas with Nimbus Plaza, Amber Plaza, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Evergreen Circle. \nThe Copper Clock Square has overlapping signal areas with Horizon Mall, Amber Plaza, Westgate Station, Jasper Marina. \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Amber Plaza, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Moonlit Promenade, Union Square Market, Evergreen Circle, Jasper Marina, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Nimbus Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Moonlit Promenade, Rosewood Hall, Knight’s Market, Evergreen Circle, Quarry Point, Jasper Marina. \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral, Westgate Station, Knight’s Market, Jasper Marina. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Westgate Station, Quarry Point, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Knight’s Market, Jasper Marina, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Moonlit Promenade has overlapping signal areas with Union Square Market, Rosewood Hall, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Union Square Market has overlapping signal areas with Evergreen Circle, Jasper Marina. \nThe Rosewood Hall has overlapping signal areas with Knight’s Market, Evergreen Circle, Quarry Point, Jasper Marina. \nThe Knight’s Market has overlapping signal areas with Quarry Point, Jasper Marina. \nThe Quarry Point has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Jasper Marina has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 24 major locations in the city: Skyline Gardens, Flint Forge Quarter, Duskwood Park, Quartz District, Ironbridge Crossing, Copper Clock Square, Primrose Boulevard, Opal Theater, Granite Plaza, Moonlit Promenade, Riverstone Wharf, Westgate Station, Lunar Pier, Zenith Arena, Cobalt Market, King’s Row, Quarry Point, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Nimbus Plaza, Mosaic Plaza, Amber Plaza, Shadowbridge Arcade, Gilded Archway and Rosewood Hall. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Ironbridge Crossing, Primrose Boulevard, Opal Theater, Granite Plaza, Moonlit Promenade, Riverstone Wharf, Lunar Pier, King’s Row, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Mosaic Plaza, Amber Plaza, Gilded Archway, Rosewood Hall. \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Ironbridge Crossing, Copper Clock Square, Granite Plaza, Riverstone Wharf, Zenith Arena, Quarry Point, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Amber Plaza, Shadowbridge Arcade, Rosewood Hall. \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Primrose Boulevard, Moonlit Promenade, King’s Row, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Nimbus Plaza, Mosaic Plaza. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Moonlit Promenade, Westgate Station, King’s Row, Nimbus Plaza, Shadowbridge Arcade, Gilded Archway. \nThe Ironbridge Crossing has overlapping signal areas with Primrose Boulevard, Opal Theater, Moonlit Promenade, Lunar Pier, Zenith Arena, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Amber Plaza, Gilded Archway, Rosewood Hall. \nThe Copper Clock Square has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza, Moonlit Promenade, Quarry Point, Mosaic Plaza, Amber Plaza, Shadowbridge Arcade, Rosewood Hall. \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater, Granite Plaza, Riverstone Wharf, Westgate Station, Zenith Arena, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Gilded Archway, Rosewood Hall. \nThe Opal Theater has overlapping signal areas with Riverstone Wharf, Westgate Station, Cobalt Market, Quarry Point, Nimbus Plaza, Mosaic Plaza, Gilded Archway. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Moonlit Promenade, Riverstone Wharf, Westgate Station, Lunar Pier, King’s Row, Quarry Point, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Shadowbridge Arcade. \nThe Moonlit Promenade has overlapping signal areas with Riverstone Wharf, Westgate Station, Lunar Pier, Zenith Arena, King’s Row, Quarry Point, Nimbus Plaza, Amber Plaza, Shadowbridge Arcade, Gilded Archway, Rosewood Hall. \nThe Riverstone Wharf has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier, Rosewood Hall. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Zenith Arena, Quarry Point, Gilded Archway. \nThe Lunar Pier has overlapping signal areas with Nimbus Plaza, Gilded Archway. \nThe Zenith Arena has overlapping signal areas with Quarry Point, Rosewood Hall. \nThe Cobalt Market has overlapping signal areas with Quarry Point, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral, Nimbus Plaza, Mosaic Plaza, Shadowbridge Arcade, Gilded Archway. \nThe Quarry Point has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral, Mosaic Plaza. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Nimbus Plaza, Rosewood Hall. \nThe Nimbus Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza, Amber Plaza, Shadowbridge Arcade. \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade, Rosewood Hall. \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway, Rosewood Hall. \nThe Shadowbridge Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway, Rosewood Hall. \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Rosewood Hall. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 24 major locations in the city: Lunar Pier, Copper Clock Square, Evergreen Circle, Rosewood Hall, Flare Alley, Yarrow Plaza, Silvercrest Observatory, Twilight Harbor, Sapphire Arena, Horizon Mall, Duskwood Park, Mosaic Plaza, Pennywhistle Arcade, Ironbridge Crossing, King’s Row, Maplewood Conservatory, Nimbus Plaza, Union Square Market, Flint Forge Quarter, Brass Lantern Tavern, Echo Station, Umbra Theater, Quarry Point and Primrose Boulevard. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Lunar Pier has overlapping signal areas with Flare Alley, Duskwood Park, Pennywhistle Arcade, Ironbridge Crossing, Maplewood Conservatory, Quarry Point. \nThe Copper Clock Square has overlapping signal areas with Flare Alley, Silvercrest Observatory, Twilight Harbor, Sapphire Arena, Duskwood Park, King’s Row, Nimbus Plaza, Brass Lantern Tavern, Umbra Theater, Quarry Point, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Evergreen Circle has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena, Horizon Mall, Maplewood Conservatory, Nimbus Plaza, Union Square Market, Flint Forge Quarter, Brass Lantern Tavern, Echo Station, Umbra Theater, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Rosewood Hall has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, Duskwood Park, King’s Row, Nimbus Plaza, Echo Station, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Twilight Harbor, Horizon Mall, Pennywhistle Arcade, Nimbus Plaza, Union Square Market, Flint Forge Quarter, Brass Lantern Tavern, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory, Twilight Harbor, Mosaic Plaza, King’s Row, Union Square Market, Flint Forge Quarter, Brass Lantern Tavern, Echo Station, Quarry Point. \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena, Duskwood Park, Ironbridge Crossing, King’s Row, Maplewood Conservatory, Nimbus Plaza, Union Square Market, Flint Forge Quarter, Echo Station, Quarry Point. \nThe Twilight Harbor has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena, Horizon Mall, Duskwood Park, Mosaic Plaza, Nimbus Plaza. \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade, Ironbridge Crossing. \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park, Ironbridge Crossing, Nimbus Plaza, Union Square Market, Flint Forge Quarter. \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade, Nimbus Plaza, Flint Forge Quarter, Echo Station, Umbra Theater, Quarry Point. \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade, King’s Row, Union Square Market, Flint Forge Quarter, Brass Lantern Tavern, Echo Station, Umbra Theater, Quarry Point, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Maplewood Conservatory, Nimbus Plaza, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Ironbridge Crossing has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Maplewood Conservatory, Nimbus Plaza, Brass Lantern Tavern, Echo Station, Quarry Point, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Maplewood Conservatory has overlapping signal areas with Flint Forge Quarter, Echo Station. \nThe Nimbus Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Union Square Market, Brass Lantern Tavern, Umbra Theater, Quarry Point, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Union Square Market has overlapping signal areas with Flint Forge Quarter, Brass Lantern Tavern, Echo Station, Umbra Theater, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Quarry Point. \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station. \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Quarry Point has overlapping signal areas with Primrose Boulevard. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 24 major locations in the city: Primrose Boulevard, Ironbridge Crossing, Skyline Gardens, King’s Row, Knight’s Market, Sapphire Arena, Beacon Tower, Yarrow Plaza, Duskwood Park, Evergreen Circle, Maplewood Conservatory, Pennywhistle Arcade, Twilight Harbor, Cobalt Market, Shadowbridge Arcade, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Silvercrest Observatory, Umbra Theater, Westgate Station, Lunar Pier, Flint Forge Quarter, Gilded Archway, Nimbus Plaza and Mosaic Plaza. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens, King’s Row, Pennywhistle Arcade, Shadowbridge Arcade, Silvercrest Observatory, Westgate Station, Nimbus Plaza, Mosaic Plaza. \nThe Ironbridge Crossing has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens, Sapphire Arena, Beacon Tower, Yarrow Plaza, Maplewood Conservatory, Pennywhistle Arcade, Cobalt Market, Gilded Archway, Mosaic Plaza. \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Knight’s Market, Sapphire Arena, Beacon Tower, Yarrow Plaza, Duskwood Park, Pennywhistle Arcade, Twilight Harbor, Shadowbridge Arcade, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Umbra Theater. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena, Beacon Tower, Twilight Harbor, Cobalt Market, Umbra Theater, Flint Forge Quarter, Gilded Archway, Mosaic Plaza. \nThe Knight’s Market has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower, Yarrow Plaza, Maplewood Conservatory, Twilight Harbor, Cobalt Market, Shadowbridge Arcade, Umbra Theater, Westgate Station, Lunar Pier, Flint Forge Quarter, Gilded Archway. \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower, Maplewood Conservatory, Westgate Station, Lunar Pier, Flint Forge Quarter, Mosaic Plaza. \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade, Umbra Theater, Lunar Pier, Flint Forge Quarter, Nimbus Plaza, Mosaic Plaza. \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park, Maplewood Conservatory, Pennywhistle Arcade, Twilight Harbor, Cobalt Market, Gilded Archway, Nimbus Plaza, Mosaic Plaza. \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Evergreen Circle, Maplewood Conservatory, Twilight Harbor, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Silvercrest Observatory, Flint Forge Quarter, Gilded Archway, Nimbus Plaza. \nThe Evergreen Circle has overlapping signal areas with Twilight Harbor, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Lunar Pier, Flint Forge Quarter. \nThe Maplewood Conservatory has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade, Twilight Harbor, Shadowbridge Arcade, Umbra Theater, Flint Forge Quarter. \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade, Umbra Theater, Mosaic Plaza. \nThe Twilight Harbor has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral, Umbra Theater, Westgate Station, Flint Forge Quarter, Mosaic Plaza. \nThe Cobalt Market has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Silvercrest Observatory, Westgate Station, Gilded Archway, Nimbus Plaza, Mosaic Plaza. \nThe Shadowbridge Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Nimbus Plaza. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory, Umbra Theater, Westgate Station. \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway, Mosaic Plaza. \nThe Umbra Theater has overlapping signal areas with Westgate Station, Lunar Pier, Gilded Archway, Nimbus Plaza, Mosaic Plaza. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway, Nimbus Plaza. \nThe Lunar Pier has overlapping signal areas with Flint Forge Quarter, Mosaic Plaza. \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Nimbus Plaza. \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Nimbus Plaza. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 24 major locations in the city: Westgate Station, Temple Square, Knight’s Market, Twilight Harbor, Shadowbridge Arcade, Copper Clock Square, Northwind Tower, Evergreen Circle, Silvercrest Observatory, Jade Fountain, Velvet Corner, Flint Forge Quarter, Rosewood Hall, Granite Plaza, Opal Theater, Quartz District, Moonlit Promenade, Skyline Gardens, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Union Square Market, Quarry Point, Jasper Marina, Zenith Arena and Lunar Pier. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Knight’s Market, Northwind Tower, Evergreen Circle, Velvet Corner, Flint Forge Quarter, Rosewood Hall, Quartz District, Moonlit Promenade, Skyline Gardens, Jasper Marina, Lunar Pier. \nThe Temple Square has overlapping signal areas with Knight’s Market, Jade Fountain, Rosewood Hall, Moonlit Promenade, Skyline Gardens. \nThe Knight’s Market has overlapping signal areas with Copper Clock Square, Silvercrest Observatory, Velvet Corner, Rosewood Hall, Moonlit Promenade, Quarry Point, Jasper Marina, Zenith Arena, Lunar Pier. \nThe Twilight Harbor has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, Velvet Corner, Flint Forge Quarter, Rosewood Hall, Granite Plaza, Opal Theater, Moonlit Promenade, Quarry Point, Jasper Marina. \nThe Shadowbridge Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, Evergreen Circle, Silvercrest Observatory, Skyline Gardens, Zenith Arena. \nThe Copper Clock Square has overlapping signal areas with Jade Fountain, Rosewood Hall, Moonlit Promenade, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Union Square Market, Quarry Point, Lunar Pier. \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with Velvet Corner, Opal Theater, Skyline Gardens, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Union Square Market, Quarry Point, Jasper Marina, Zenith Arena, Lunar Pier. \nThe Evergreen Circle has overlapping signal areas with Jade Fountain, Opal Theater, Moonlit Promenade, Union Square Market, Quarry Point, Zenith Arena. \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with Jade Fountain, Flint Forge Quarter, Rosewood Hall, Granite Plaza, Quartz District, Skyline Gardens, Union Square Market, Jasper Marina, Zenith Arena. \nThe Jade Fountain has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza, Opal Theater, Quartz District, Skyline Gardens, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Union Square Market, Quarry Point, Zenith Arena. \nThe Velvet Corner has overlapping signal areas with Rosewood Hall, Granite Plaza, Quartz District, Moonlit Promenade, Jasper Marina, Zenith Arena. \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza, Opal Theater, Moonlit Promenade, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Jasper Marina, Zenith Arena. \nThe Rosewood Hall has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater, Quartz District, Moonlit Promenade, Skyline Gardens. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral, Union Square Market, Quarry Point. \nThe Opal Theater has overlapping signal areas with Union Square Market, Zenith Arena, Lunar Pier. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Quarry Point, Lunar Pier. \nThe Moonlit Promenade has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens, Quarry Point, Jasper Marina. \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral, Quarry Point, Jasper Marina, Zenith Arena. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier. \nThe Union Square Market has overlapping signal areas with Zenith Arena. \nThe Quarry Point has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier. \nThe Jasper Marina has overlapping signal areas with Zenith Arena. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 24 major locations in the city: Quartz District, Knight’s Market, Evergreen Circle, Twilight Harbor, Opal Theater, Flint Forge Quarter, Primrose Boulevard, Lighthouse Point, Dragon’s Gate, Lunar Pier, Azure Gardens, Umbra Theater, Silvercrest Observatory, Copper Clock Square, Echo Station, King’s Row, Maplewood Conservatory, Granite Plaza, Northwind Tower, Rosewood Hall, Haven Docks, Union Square Market, Temple Square and Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Knight’s Market, Opal Theater, Primrose Boulevard, Lighthouse Point, Dragon’s Gate, Lunar Pier, Umbra Theater, Northwind Tower, Union Square Market. \nThe Knight’s Market has overlapping signal areas with Twilight Harbor, Opal Theater, Lighthouse Point, Lunar Pier, Azure Gardens, Umbra Theater, Maplewood Conservatory, Northwind Tower, Haven Docks, Union Square Market, Temple Square, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Evergreen Circle has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater, Flint Forge Quarter, Primrose Boulevard, Lunar Pier, Silvercrest Observatory, Echo Station, Granite Plaza, Northwind Tower, Rosewood Hall, Union Square Market. \nThe Twilight Harbor has overlapping signal areas with Primrose Boulevard, Umbra Theater, Silvercrest Observatory, Copper Clock Square, Echo Station, King’s Row, Rosewood Hall, Haven Docks, Union Square Market, Temple Square. \nThe Opal Theater has overlapping signal areas with Flint Forge Quarter, Dragon’s Gate, Silvercrest Observatory, King’s Row, Haven Docks, Union Square Market, Temple Square. \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Lighthouse Point, Echo Station, King’s Row, Haven Docks, Union Square Market. \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier, Silvercrest Observatory, Echo Station, Granite Plaza, Northwind Tower, Rosewood Hall, Union Square Market, Temple Square. \nThe Lighthouse Point has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza, Northwind Tower, Rosewood Hall, Haven Docks, Union Square Market, Temple Square. \nThe Dragon’s Gate has overlapping signal areas with Rosewood Hall, Haven Docks. \nThe Lunar Pier has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater, Silvercrest Observatory, Echo Station, Northwind Tower, Rosewood Hall, Haven Docks, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Azure Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater, Silvercrest Observatory, Echo Station, King’s Row, Granite Plaza, Rosewood Hall, Union Square Market, Temple Square. \nThe Umbra Theater has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory. \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with Copper Clock Square, King’s Row, Northwind Tower, Rosewood Hall, Haven Docks, Temple Square, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Copper Clock Square has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Maplewood Conservatory, Granite Plaza, Union Square Market. \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, Union Square Market. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Maplewood Conservatory, Granite Plaza, Northwind Tower, Haven Docks, Union Square Market, Temple Square. \nThe Maplewood Conservatory has overlapping signal areas with Haven Docks. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, Haven Docks. \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with Rosewood Hall, Union Square Market. \nThe Rosewood Hall has overlapping signal areas with Temple Square, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Haven Docks has overlapping signal areas with Union Square Market, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Union Square Market has overlapping signal areas with Temple Square. \nThe Temple Square has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 24 major locations in the city: Primrose Boulevard, Riverstone Wharf, Granite Plaza, Ivory Spire Cathedral, King’s Row, Northwind Tower, Skyline Gardens, Silvercrest Observatory, Yarrow Plaza, Jade Fountain, Zenith Arena, Duskwood Park, Pennywhistle Arcade, Flint Forge Quarter, Oakshade Library, Quarry Point, Mosaic Plaza, Copper Clock Square, Twilight Harbor, Shadowbridge Arcade, Gilded Archway, Maplewood Conservatory, Westgate Station and Rosewood Hall. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, Zenith Arena, Duskwood Park, Mosaic Plaza, Copper Clock Square, Twilight Harbor, Shadowbridge Arcade, Gilded Archway, Maplewood Conservatory, Rosewood Hall. \nThe Riverstone Wharf has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Northwind Tower, Pennywhistle Arcade, Oakshade Library, Gilded Archway, Maplewood Conservatory, Westgate Station, Rosewood Hall. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens, Silvercrest Observatory, Zenith Arena, Pennywhistle Arcade, Copper Clock Square, Gilded Archway, Maplewood Conservatory, Westgate Station. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Northwind Tower, Yarrow Plaza, Zenith Arena, Flint Forge Quarter, Oakshade Library, Quarry Point, Mosaic Plaza, Copper Clock Square, Twilight Harbor, Maplewood Conservatory, Rosewood Hall. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory, Jade Fountain, Zenith Arena, Pennywhistle Arcade, Flint Forge Quarter, Oakshade Library, Mosaic Plaza, Copper Clock Square, Twilight Harbor, Shadowbridge Arcade, Rosewood Hall. \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with Jade Fountain, Zenith Arena, Oakshade Library, Maplewood Conservatory, Westgate Station, Rosewood Hall. \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Jade Fountain, Zenith Arena, Duskwood Park, Pennywhistle Arcade, Quarry Point, Copper Clock Square, Shadowbridge Arcade, Gilded Archway, Westgate Station. \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park, Pennywhistle Arcade, Quarry Point, Mosaic Plaza, Twilight Harbor, Rosewood Hall. \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Jade Fountain, Zenith Arena, Duskwood Park, Pennywhistle Arcade, Flint Forge Quarter, Quarry Point, Mosaic Plaza, Copper Clock Square, Gilded Archway, Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Jade Fountain has overlapping signal areas with Zenith Arena, Quarry Point, Copper Clock Square, Gilded Archway, Rosewood Hall. \nThe Zenith Arena has overlapping signal areas with Quarry Point, Gilded Archway, Westgate Station. \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Flint Forge Quarter, Oakshade Library, Copper Clock Square, Rosewood Hall. \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Flint Forge Quarter, Oakshade Library, Gilded Archway, Maplewood Conservatory, Rosewood Hall. \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Oakshade Library, Quarry Point, Shadowbridge Arcade, Maplewood Conservatory, Westgate Station. \nThe Oakshade Library has overlapping signal areas with Copper Clock Square, Westgate Station. \nThe Quarry Point has overlapping signal areas with Twilight Harbor, Shadowbridge Arcade. \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Copper Clock Square, Twilight Harbor. \nThe Copper Clock Square has overlapping signal areas with Twilight Harbor, Gilded Archway, Maplewood Conservatory, Rosewood Hall. \nThe Shadowbridge Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway, Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Westgate Station. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 24 major locations in the city: Flare Alley, Pennywhistle Arcade, Yarrow Plaza, Gilded Archway, Quarry Point, Riverstone Wharf, Opal Theater, Zenith Arena, Quartz District, Lighthouse Point, Amber Plaza, Knight’s Market, King’s Row, Copper Clock Square, Twilight Harbor, Evergreen Circle, Union Square Market, Horizon Mall, Brass Lantern Tavern, Azure Gardens, Umbra Theater, Jade Fountain, Skyline Gardens and Maplewood Conservatory. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, Gilded Archway, Quartz District, Evergreen Circle, Union Square Market, Horizon Mall, Umbra Theater, Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, Gilded Archway, Riverstone Wharf, Quartz District, Knight’s Market, King’s Row, Copper Clock Square, Twilight Harbor, Evergreen Circle, Brass Lantern Tavern, Azure Gardens, Umbra Theater, Jade Fountain, Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway, Riverstone Wharf, Opal Theater, Zenith Arena, Amber Plaza, Knight’s Market, Horizon Mall, Azure Gardens, Jade Fountain, Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Riverstone Wharf, Amber Plaza, King’s Row, Evergreen Circle, Union Square Market, Horizon Mall, Azure Gardens, Jade Fountain, Skyline Gardens, Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Quarry Point has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater, Quartz District, Lighthouse Point, Horizon Mall, Azure Gardens, Umbra Theater, Jade Fountain, Skyline Gardens, Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Riverstone Wharf has overlapping signal areas with Quartz District, Lighthouse Point, Amber Plaza, Knight’s Market, King’s Row, Copper Clock Square, Union Square Market, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Opal Theater has overlapping signal areas with Quartz District, Amber Plaza, Knight’s Market, Twilight Harbor, Union Square Market, Azure Gardens, Jade Fountain, Skyline Gardens. \nThe Zenith Arena has overlapping signal areas with Quartz District, Copper Clock Square, Twilight Harbor, Evergreen Circle. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Lighthouse Point, Union Square Market, Brass Lantern Tavern, Azure Gardens, Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Lighthouse Point has overlapping signal areas with Twilight Harbor, Evergreen Circle, Union Square Market, Horizon Mall, Brass Lantern Tavern, Azure Gardens, Jade Fountain. \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Knight’s Market, King’s Row, Evergreen Circle, Horizon Mall, Brass Lantern Tavern, Azure Gardens, Skyline Gardens. \nThe Knight’s Market has overlapping signal areas with Azure Gardens, Umbra Theater. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Twilight Harbor, Evergreen Circle, Brass Lantern Tavern, Umbra Theater. \nThe Copper Clock Square has overlapping signal areas with Twilight Harbor, Evergreen Circle, Horizon Mall, Skyline Gardens. \nThe Twilight Harbor has overlapping signal areas with Union Square Market, Brass Lantern Tavern, Skyline Gardens. \nThe Evergreen Circle has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Skyline Gardens. \nThe Union Square Market has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Jade Fountain. \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Azure Gardens, Jade Fountain, Skyline Gardens. \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater, Jade Fountain. \nThe Umbra Theater has overlapping signal areas with Jade Fountain, Skyline Gardens. \nThe Jade Fountain has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, Temple Square, Cobalt Market, Sapphire Arena, Flare Alley, Skyline Gardens, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Umbra Theater, Twilight Harbor. \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with Temple Square, Moonlit Promenade, Copper Clock Square, Nimbus Plaza, Sapphire Arena, King’s Row, Flare Alley, Brass Lantern Tavern, Quartz District, Skyline Gardens, Lunar Pier, Twilight Harbor. \nThe Temple Square has overlapping signal areas with Moonlit Promenade, Cobalt Market, Sapphire Arena, Beacon Tower, Brass Lantern Tavern, Quartz District, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Ironbridge Crossing, Lunar Pier, Twilight Harbor, Velvet Corner. \nThe Moonlit Promenade has overlapping signal areas with Copper Clock Square, Nimbus Plaza, Flare Alley, Quartz District, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Umbra Theater, Knight’s Market, Opal Theater, Twilight Harbor. \nThe Copper Clock Square has overlapping signal areas with Flare Alley, Haven Docks, Brass Lantern Tavern, Quartz District, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Knight’s Market, Lunar Pier, Zenith Arena. \nThe Nimbus Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Flare Alley, Umbra Theater, Knight’s Market, Ironbridge Crossing, Opal Theater, Twilight Harbor, Velvet Corner. \nThe Cobalt Market has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Beacon Tower, Haven Docks, Quartz District, Skyline Gardens, Umbra Theater, Ironbridge Crossing, Opal Theater, Zenith Arena, Velvet Corner. \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower, Skyline Gardens, Umbra Theater, Knight’s Market, Opal Theater, Twilight Harbor. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Quartz District, Knight’s Market, Ironbridge Crossing. \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower, Brass Lantern Tavern, Skyline Gardens, Knight’s Market, Lunar Pier, Twilight Harbor, Velvet Corner. \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with Quartz District, Umbra Theater, Ironbridge Crossing, Lunar Pier, Velvet Corner. \nThe Haven Docks has overlapping signal areas with Quartz District, Umbra Theater, Knight’s Market, Ironbridge Crossing, Lunar Pier, Zenith Arena. \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with Knight’s Market. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens, Ironbridge Crossing, Opal Theater, Lunar Pier, Velvet Corner. \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral, Opal Theater, Twilight Harbor. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater, Knight’s Market, Lunar Pier, Twilight Harbor, Zenith Arena. \nThe Umbra Theater has overlapping signal areas with Knight’s Market, Lunar Pier, Twilight Harbor. \nThe Knight’s Market has overlapping signal areas with Zenith Arena. \nThe Ironbridge Crossing has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier. \nThe Opal Theater has overlapping signal areas with Velvet Corner. \nThe Twilight Harbor has overlapping signal areas with Zenith Arena. \nThe Zenith Arena has overlapping signal areas with Velvet Corner. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 24 major locations in the city: Copper Clock Square, Sapphire Arena, Velvet Corner, Yarrow Plaza, King’s Row, Azure Gardens, Flint Forge Quarter, Cobalt Market, Rosewood Hall, Union Square Market, Horizon Mall, Oakshade Library, Quartz District, Duskwood Park, Beacon Tower, Amber Plaza, Moonlit Promenade, Temple Square, Granite Plaza, Pennywhistle Arcade, Twilight Harbor, Echo Station, Quarry Point and Knight’s Market. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Copper Clock Square has overlapping signal areas with Velvet Corner, Union Square Market, Horizon Mall, Oakshade Library, Beacon Tower, Amber Plaza, Moonlit Promenade, Pennywhistle Arcade, Echo Station, Quarry Point, Knight’s Market. \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, Flint Forge Quarter, Cobalt Market, Horizon Mall, Oakshade Library, Quartz District, Amber Plaza, Temple Square, Twilight Harbor, Quarry Point, Knight’s Market. \nThe Velvet Corner has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, King’s Row, Flint Forge Quarter, Rosewood Hall, Oakshade Library, Quartz District, Duskwood Park, Amber Plaza, Moonlit Promenade, Temple Square, Twilight Harbor, Quarry Point. \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Rosewood Hall, Beacon Tower, Moonlit Promenade, Quarry Point, Knight’s Market. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Flint Forge Quarter, Cobalt Market, Rosewood Hall, Oakshade Library, Moonlit Promenade, Echo Station, Quarry Point, Knight’s Market. \nThe Azure Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Flint Forge Quarter, Cobalt Market, Horizon Mall, Amber Plaza, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Horizon Mall, Quartz District, Duskwood Park, Pennywhistle Arcade, Echo Station, Knight’s Market. \nThe Cobalt Market has overlapping signal areas with Rosewood Hall, Union Square Market, Moonlit Promenade, Granite Plaza, Pennywhistle Arcade, Echo Station. \nThe Rosewood Hall has overlapping signal areas with Horizon Mall, Quartz District, Duskwood Park, Amber Plaza, Moonlit Promenade, Temple Square, Granite Plaza, Twilight Harbor. \nThe Union Square Market has overlapping signal areas with Quartz District, Moonlit Promenade, Granite Plaza, Pennywhistle Arcade, Quarry Point, Knight’s Market. \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Oakshade Library, Granite Plaza, Twilight Harbor, Knight’s Market. \nThe Oakshade Library has overlapping signal areas with Quartz District, Beacon Tower, Twilight Harbor. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower, Amber Plaza, Temple Square, Twilight Harbor, Echo Station, Knight’s Market. \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower, Amber Plaza, Pennywhistle Arcade, Twilight Harbor. \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with Moonlit Promenade, Twilight Harbor, Knight’s Market. \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Moonlit Promenade, Temple Square, Twilight Harbor, Echo Station, Quarry Point, Knight’s Market. \nThe Moonlit Promenade has overlapping signal areas with Temple Square, Pennywhistle Arcade, Quarry Point. \nThe Temple Square has overlapping signal areas with Twilight Harbor. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade, Twilight Harbor, Quarry Point. \nThe Twilight Harbor has overlapping signal areas with Quarry Point, Knight’s Market. \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with Knight’s Market. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 24 major locations in the city: Westgate Station, Union Square Market, Jade Fountain, Evergreen Circle, Primrose Boulevard, Brass Lantern Tavern, Haven Docks, Jasper Marina, Sapphire Arena, Dragon’s Gate, Granite Plaza, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Azure Gardens, Lighthouse Point, Skyline Gardens, Willowshade Pavilion, Moonlit Promenade, Flint Forge Quarter, Silvercrest Observatory, Mosaic Plaza, Gilded Archway, King’s Row, Northwind Tower and Maplewood Conservatory. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Union Square Market, Jade Fountain, Evergreen Circle, Haven Docks, Jasper Marina, Sapphire Arena, Dragon’s Gate, Granite Plaza, Willowshade Pavilion, Moonlit Promenade, Flint Forge Quarter, Silvercrest Observatory, Mosaic Plaza, Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Union Square Market has overlapping signal areas with Evergreen Circle, Haven Docks, Jasper Marina, Sapphire Arena, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Mosaic Plaza, King’s Row, Northwind Tower. \nThe Jade Fountain has overlapping signal areas with Evergreen Circle, Sapphire Arena, Dragon’s Gate, Granite Plaza, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Skyline Gardens, Willowshade Pavilion, Flint Forge Quarter, Silvercrest Observatory, Gilded Archway. \nThe Evergreen Circle has overlapping signal areas with Haven Docks, Sapphire Arena, Dragon’s Gate, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Azure Gardens, Lighthouse Point, Willowshade Pavilion, Moonlit Promenade, Flint Forge Quarter. \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina, Sapphire Arena, Skyline Gardens, Flint Forge Quarter. \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with Haven Docks, Jasper Marina, Dragon’s Gate, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Azure Gardens, Lighthouse Point, Skyline Gardens, Willowshade Pavilion, Moonlit Promenade, Silvercrest Observatory, Mosaic Plaza, Gilded Archway. \nThe Haven Docks has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena, Azure Gardens, Moonlit Promenade, Mosaic Plaza, Northwind Tower. \nThe Jasper Marina has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral, Azure Gardens, Lighthouse Point, Skyline Gardens, Willowshade Pavilion, Moonlit Promenade, Silvercrest Observatory, Gilded Archway, King’s Row. \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with Dragon’s Gate, Granite Plaza, Moonlit Promenade, Mosaic Plaza, Gilded Archway, King’s Row. \nThe Dragon’s Gate has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza, Azure Gardens, Flint Forge Quarter, Gilded Archway. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Azure Gardens, Moonlit Promenade, Flint Forge Quarter. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Azure Gardens, Willowshade Pavilion, Moonlit Promenade, Flint Forge Quarter, Mosaic Plaza, Gilded Archway, King’s Row, Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Azure Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens, Moonlit Promenade, Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Lighthouse Point has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory. \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory, King’s Row, Northwind Tower. \nThe Willowshade Pavilion has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory, Northwind Tower. \nThe Moonlit Promenade has overlapping signal areas with Flint Forge Quarter, Gilded Archway, King’s Row, Northwind Tower. \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway, King’s Row. \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway, King’s Row, Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Northwind Tower. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, Maplewood Conservatory. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 24 major locations in the city: Opal Theater, Azure Gardens, Jade Fountain, Horizon Mall, Union Square Market, Beacon Tower, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Flint Forge Quarter, Westgate Station, Lunar Pier, Flare Alley, Willowshade Pavilion, Mosaic Plaza, Sapphire Arena, Gilded Archway, Quarry Point, Silvercrest Observatory, Brass Lantern Tavern, Jasper Marina, Lighthouse Point, Duskwood Park, Oakshade Library, Moonlit Promenade and King’s Row. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Opal Theater has overlapping signal areas with Jade Fountain, Beacon Tower, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Lunar Pier, Willowshade Pavilion, Mosaic Plaza, Sapphire Arena, Jasper Marina, Oakshade Library. \nThe Azure Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Horizon Mall, Union Square Market, Flint Forge Quarter, Lunar Pier, Willowshade Pavilion, Mosaic Plaza, Gilded Archway, Duskwood Park. \nThe Jade Fountain has overlapping signal areas with Horizon Mall, Union Square Market, Beacon Tower, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Flint Forge Quarter, Lunar Pier, Flare Alley, Sapphire Arena, Gilded Archway, Jasper Marina, Duskwood Park, Moonlit Promenade, King’s Row. \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Flint Forge Quarter, Lunar Pier, Mosaic Plaza, Sapphire Arena, Silvercrest Observatory, Brass Lantern Tavern, Jasper Marina, Lighthouse Point, Duskwood Park, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Union Square Market has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Flint Forge Quarter, Flare Alley, Willowshade Pavilion, Sapphire Arena, Gilded Archway, Silvercrest Observatory, Jasper Marina, Lighthouse Point, Duskwood Park, Oakshade Library, King’s Row. \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral, Westgate Station, Mosaic Plaza, Brass Lantern Tavern, Lighthouse Point, Duskwood Park, King’s Row. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier, Gilded Archway, Duskwood Park, Oakshade Library, King’s Row. \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier, Flare Alley, Willowshade Pavilion, Mosaic Plaza, Sapphire Arena, Silvercrest Observatory, Brass Lantern Tavern, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Mosaic Plaza, Sapphire Arena, Gilded Archway, Jasper Marina, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Lunar Pier has overlapping signal areas with Flare Alley, Willowshade Pavilion, Mosaic Plaza, Gilded Archway, Quarry Point, Moonlit Promenade, King’s Row. \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Quarry Point. \nThe Willowshade Pavilion has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena, Gilded Archway, Quarry Point, Brass Lantern Tavern, Duskwood Park. \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena, Silvercrest Observatory, Brass Lantern Tavern, Jasper Marina, Lighthouse Point. \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina, Moonlit Promenade, King’s Row. \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory, Brass Lantern Tavern, Jasper Marina, Oakshade Library. \nThe Quarry Point has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Jasper Marina, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Jasper Marina, Lighthouse Point, Oakshade Library, King’s Row. \nThe Jasper Marina has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park. \nThe Lighthouse Point has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park, Oakshade Library. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 24 major locations in the city: Jasper Marina, Granite Plaza, Flare Alley, Jade Fountain, Skyline Gardens, Riverstone Wharf, Amber Plaza, Dragon’s Gate, Northwind Tower, Pennywhistle Arcade, Primrose Boulevard, Knight’s Market, Willowshade Pavilion, Echo Station, Velvet Corner, Haven Docks, Westgate Station, Ironbridge Crossing, Yarrow Plaza, Gilded Archway, Lunar Pier, King’s Row, Ivory Spire Cathedral and Lighthouse Point. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Jasper Marina has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens, Riverstone Wharf, Amber Plaza, Dragon’s Gate, Pennywhistle Arcade, Knight’s Market, Westgate Station, Ironbridge Crossing, King’s Row, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Lighthouse Point. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Riverstone Wharf, Northwind Tower, Willowshade Pavilion, Westgate Station, Lunar Pier, King’s Row, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Lighthouse Point. \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Riverstone Wharf, Amber Plaza, Dragon’s Gate, Primrose Boulevard, Knight’s Market, Willowshade Pavilion, Echo Station, Velvet Corner, Haven Docks, Westgate Station, Yarrow Plaza, Gilded Archway, Lunar Pier, King’s Row. \nThe Jade Fountain has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens, Amber Plaza, Pennywhistle Arcade, Knight’s Market, Willowshade Pavilion, Echo Station, Westgate Station, Ironbridge Crossing, Yarrow Plaza, Gilded Archway, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Lighthouse Point. \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Amber Plaza, Primrose Boulevard, Echo Station, Haven Docks, Ironbridge Crossing, Lunar Pier, King’s Row, Lighthouse Point. \nThe Riverstone Wharf has overlapping signal areas with Dragon’s Gate, Northwind Tower, Pennywhistle Arcade, Primrose Boulevard, Knight’s Market, Echo Station, Gilded Archway, King’s Row, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Lighthouse Point. \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, Pennywhistle Arcade, Velvet Corner, Haven Docks, Gilded Archway, Lunar Pier. \nThe Dragon’s Gate has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, Knight’s Market. \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Echo Station, Velvet Corner, Westgate Station, Yarrow Plaza, Lunar Pier. \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Velvet Corner, Yarrow Plaza. \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with Westgate Station, Lunar Pier, King’s Row, Lighthouse Point. \nThe Knight’s Market has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station, Ironbridge Crossing, Yarrow Plaza, Gilded Archway, King’s Row, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Willowshade Pavilion has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station, Haven Docks, Westgate Station, Yarrow Plaza, King’s Row, Lighthouse Point. \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with Westgate Station, Lunar Pier, King’s Row. \nThe Velvet Corner has overlapping signal areas with Westgate Station, Gilded Archway, Lighthouse Point. \nThe Haven Docks has overlapping signal areas with Ironbridge Crossing, Gilded Archway, Lunar Pier. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Ironbridge Crossing, Lunar Pier, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Lighthouse Point. \nThe Ironbridge Crossing has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, King’s Row, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway. \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier. \nThe Lunar Pier has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 24 major locations in the city: Cobalt Market, Evergreen Circle, Copper Clock Square, Flint Forge Quarter, Riverstone Wharf, Nimbus Plaza, Umbra Theater, Flare Alley, Yarrow Plaza, Silvercrest Observatory, Westgate Station, Gilded Archway, Granite Plaza, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Mosaic Plaza, King’s Row, Shadowbridge Arcade, Moonlit Promenade, Sapphire Arena, Willowshade Pavilion, Beacon Tower, Zenith Arena, Knight’s Market and Velvet Corner. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Cobalt Market has overlapping signal areas with Copper Clock Square, Flint Forge Quarter, Riverstone Wharf, Nimbus Plaza, Flare Alley, Granite Plaza, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Mosaic Plaza, Beacon Tower, Zenith Arena, Knight’s Market, Velvet Corner. \nThe Evergreen Circle has overlapping signal areas with Copper Clock Square, Flint Forge Quarter, Riverstone Wharf, Nimbus Plaza, Yarrow Plaza, Westgate Station, Ivory Spire Cathedral, King’s Row, Knight’s Market. \nThe Copper Clock Square has overlapping signal areas with Flint Forge Quarter, Riverstone Wharf, Nimbus Plaza, Flare Alley, Yarrow Plaza, King’s Row, Willowshade Pavilion. \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Riverstone Wharf, Flare Alley, Yarrow Plaza, Silvercrest Observatory, Westgate Station, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Mosaic Plaza, King’s Row, Moonlit Promenade, Knight’s Market. \nThe Riverstone Wharf has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater, Flare Alley, Yarrow Plaza, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Shadowbridge Arcade, Sapphire Arena, Willowshade Pavilion, Beacon Tower, Zenith Arena. \nThe Nimbus Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater, Flare Alley, Moonlit Promenade, Sapphire Arena, Willowshade Pavilion, Beacon Tower, Knight’s Market. \nThe Umbra Theater has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway, Granite Plaza, Ivory Spire Cathedral, King’s Row, Moonlit Promenade, Velvet Corner. \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Moonlit Promenade, Zenith Arena. \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza, Beacon Tower, Knight’s Market. \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway, Granite Plaza, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Shadowbridge Arcade, Moonlit Promenade, Willowshade Pavilion, Knight’s Market, Velvet Corner. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway, Sapphire Arena, Beacon Tower, Knight’s Market. \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza, Ivory Spire Cathedral, King’s Row, Shadowbridge Arcade, Willowshade Pavilion, Zenith Arena. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza, Knight’s Market. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Shadowbridge Arcade, Moonlit Promenade, Zenith Arena. \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Moonlit Promenade, Willowshade Pavilion, Beacon Tower, Velvet Corner. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Moonlit Promenade, Zenith Arena, Knight’s Market, Velvet Corner. \nThe Shadowbridge Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Beacon Tower, Zenith Arena, Knight’s Market. \nThe Moonlit Promenade has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena, Willowshade Pavilion, Beacon Tower, Zenith Arena, Knight’s Market, Velvet Corner. \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Velvet Corner. \nThe Willowshade Pavilion has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower, Knight’s Market. \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with Zenith Arena, Knight’s Market. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 24 major locations in the city: Temple Square, Nimbus Plaza, Riverstone Wharf, Haven Docks, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Umbra Theater, Pennywhistle Arcade, Amber Plaza, Silvercrest Observatory, Jade Fountain, Copper Clock Square, Gilded Archway, Flare Alley, Shadowbridge Arcade, Quartz District, Echo Station, Rosewood Hall, Moonlit Promenade, Velvet Corner, Twilight Harbor, Oakshade Library, Lighthouse Point, Horizon Mall and Dragon’s Gate. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Temple Square has overlapping signal areas with Nimbus Plaza, Riverstone Wharf, Haven Docks, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Rosewood Hall, Moonlit Promenade, Lighthouse Point. \nThe Nimbus Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral, Umbra Theater, Jade Fountain, Flare Alley, Shadowbridge Arcade, Velvet Corner, Oakshade Library, Lighthouse Point, Horizon Mall, Dragon’s Gate. \nThe Riverstone Wharf has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral, Umbra Theater, Pennywhistle Arcade, Amber Plaza, Silvercrest Observatory, Jade Fountain, Copper Clock Square, Gilded Archway, Rosewood Hall, Moonlit Promenade, Oakshade Library, Lighthouse Point, Horizon Mall. \nThe Haven Docks has overlapping signal areas with Copper Clock Square, Flare Alley, Echo Station, Rosewood Hall, Moonlit Promenade, Velvet Corner, Oakshade Library, Horizon Mall. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade, Gilded Archway, Quartz District, Twilight Harbor, Dragon’s Gate. \nThe Umbra Theater has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade, Jade Fountain, Flare Alley, Shadowbridge Arcade, Rosewood Hall, Velvet Corner, Oakshade Library, Dragon’s Gate. \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Amber Plaza, Silvercrest Observatory, Flare Alley, Shadowbridge Arcade, Velvet Corner, Horizon Mall. \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory, Jade Fountain, Gilded Archway, Rosewood Hall, Lighthouse Point, Dragon’s Gate. \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with Jade Fountain, Gilded Archway, Shadowbridge Arcade, Echo Station, Velvet Corner, Lighthouse Point, Horizon Mall. \nThe Jade Fountain has overlapping signal areas with Copper Clock Square, Shadowbridge Arcade, Quartz District, Echo Station, Moonlit Promenade, Velvet Corner, Dragon’s Gate. \nThe Copper Clock Square has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway, Flare Alley, Echo Station, Velvet Corner. \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station, Rosewood Hall, Twilight Harbor, Lighthouse Point. \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade, Quartz District, Rosewood Hall, Lighthouse Point, Horizon Mall. \nThe Shadowbridge Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Quartz District, Velvet Corner, Oakshade Library, Lighthouse Point. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Velvet Corner, Twilight Harbor, Lighthouse Point, Dragon’s Gate. \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with Rosewood Hall, Oakshade Library, Lighthouse Point. \nThe Rosewood Hall has overlapping signal areas with Moonlit Promenade, Velvet Corner, Twilight Harbor, Oakshade Library, Horizon Mall. \nThe Moonlit Promenade has overlapping signal areas with Oakshade Library. \nThe Velvet Corner has overlapping signal areas with Oakshade Library, Dragon’s Gate. \nThe Twilight Harbor has overlapping signal areas with Lighthouse Point, Horizon Mall, Dragon’s Gate. \nThe Oakshade Library has overlapping signal areas with Horizon Mall. \nThe Lighthouse Point has overlapping signal areas with Horizon Mall, Dragon’s Gate. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 24 major locations in the city: Union Square Market, Jade Fountain, Dragon’s Gate, Amber Plaza, Sapphire Arena, Lighthouse Point, Jasper Marina, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Primrose Boulevard, Brass Lantern Tavern, Moonlit Promenade, Maplewood Conservatory, Beacon Tower, Velvet Corner, Gilded Archway, Duskwood Park, Twilight Harbor, Westgate Station, Shadowbridge Arcade, Evergreen Circle, Azure Gardens, Knight’s Market, Haven Docks and Mosaic Plaza. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Union Square Market has overlapping signal areas with Amber Plaza, Sapphire Arena, Jasper Marina, Brass Lantern Tavern, Beacon Tower, Velvet Corner, Twilight Harbor, Westgate Station, Knight’s Market. \nThe Jade Fountain has overlapping signal areas with Dragon’s Gate, Amber Plaza, Sapphire Arena, Jasper Marina, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Brass Lantern Tavern, Moonlit Promenade, Maplewood Conservatory, Velvet Corner, Gilded Archway, Evergreen Circle, Azure Gardens. \nThe Dragon’s Gate has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena, Moonlit Promenade, Maplewood Conservatory, Gilded Archway, Duskwood Park, Twilight Harbor, Azure Gardens, Knight’s Market, Haven Docks, Mosaic Plaza. \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral, Moonlit Promenade, Velvet Corner, Twilight Harbor, Shadowbridge Arcade, Mosaic Plaza. \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with Lighthouse Point, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Primrose Boulevard, Brass Lantern Tavern, Moonlit Promenade, Beacon Tower, Velvet Corner, Gilded Archway, Duskwood Park, Twilight Harbor, Shadowbridge Arcade, Haven Docks, Mosaic Plaza. \nThe Lighthouse Point has overlapping signal areas with Primrose Boulevard, Moonlit Promenade, Velvet Corner, Gilded Archway, Duskwood Park, Westgate Station. \nThe Jasper Marina has overlapping signal areas with Moonlit Promenade, Maplewood Conservatory, Beacon Tower, Duskwood Park, Shadowbridge Arcade, Azure Gardens. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Primrose Boulevard, Moonlit Promenade, Beacon Tower, Gilded Archway, Twilight Harbor, Westgate Station, Shadowbridge Arcade. \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with Moonlit Promenade, Beacon Tower, Gilded Archway, Duskwood Park, Twilight Harbor, Westgate Station, Knight’s Market, Haven Docks, Mosaic Plaza. \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower, Velvet Corner, Shadowbridge Arcade, Evergreen Circle, Azure Gardens, Knight’s Market. \nThe Moonlit Promenade has overlapping signal areas with Velvet Corner, Duskwood Park, Shadowbridge Arcade, Haven Docks. \nThe Maplewood Conservatory has overlapping signal areas with Velvet Corner, Gilded Archway, Twilight Harbor, Azure Gardens. \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with Velvet Corner, Duskwood Park, Westgate Station, Evergreen Circle, Azure Gardens, Mosaic Plaza. \nThe Velvet Corner has overlapping signal areas with Westgate Station, Azure Gardens, Mosaic Plaza. \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park, Westgate Station, Evergreen Circle, Knight’s Market. \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade. \nThe Twilight Harbor has overlapping signal areas with Evergreen Circle. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Evergreen Circle, Knight’s Market, Mosaic Plaza. \nThe Shadowbridge Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Knight’s Market. \nThe Evergreen Circle has overlapping signal areas with Haven Docks, Mosaic Plaza. \nThe Knight’s Market has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza. \nThe Haven Docks has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 24 major locations in the city: Jasper Marina, Moonlit Promenade, Zenith Arena, Flare Alley, Union Square Market, Brass Lantern Tavern, Lunar Pier, Quartz District, Umbra Theater, Duskwood Park, Azure Gardens, Twilight Harbor, Beacon Tower, Cobalt Market, Sapphire Arena, Knight’s Market, Nimbus Plaza, Silvercrest Observatory, Primrose Boulevard, Mosaic Plaza, Flint Forge Quarter, Oakshade Library, Willowshade Pavilion and Dragon’s Gate. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Jasper Marina has overlapping signal areas with Flare Alley, Union Square Market, Lunar Pier, Knight’s Market, Mosaic Plaza, Flint Forge Quarter, Oakshade Library, Willowshade Pavilion, Dragon’s Gate. \nThe Moonlit Promenade has overlapping signal areas with Union Square Market, Brass Lantern Tavern, Lunar Pier, Azure Gardens, Cobalt Market, Sapphire Arena. \nThe Zenith Arena has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier, Quartz District, Azure Gardens, Twilight Harbor, Nimbus Plaza, Willowshade Pavilion, Dragon’s Gate. \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Union Square Market, Brass Lantern Tavern, Lunar Pier, Azure Gardens, Beacon Tower, Cobalt Market, Silvercrest Observatory, Flint Forge Quarter, Oakshade Library. \nThe Union Square Market has overlapping signal areas with Quartz District, Azure Gardens, Beacon Tower, Nimbus Plaza, Oakshade Library. \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with Quartz District, Duskwood Park, Beacon Tower, Cobalt Market, Sapphire Arena, Nimbus Plaza, Mosaic Plaza, Oakshade Library, Dragon’s Gate. \nThe Lunar Pier has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park, Azure Gardens, Cobalt Market, Sapphire Arena, Knight’s Market, Nimbus Plaza, Silvercrest Observatory, Flint Forge Quarter, Oakshade Library. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater, Azure Gardens, Cobalt Market, Silvercrest Observatory, Mosaic Plaza, Flint Forge Quarter, Willowshade Pavilion, Dragon’s Gate. \nThe Umbra Theater has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park, Azure Gardens, Sapphire Arena, Nimbus Plaza, Silvercrest Observatory, Primrose Boulevard, Oakshade Library, Willowshade Pavilion. \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Twilight Harbor, Cobalt Market, Sapphire Arena, Nimbus Plaza, Silvercrest Observatory, Mosaic Plaza, Oakshade Library, Willowshade Pavilion. \nThe Azure Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena, Nimbus Plaza, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Twilight Harbor has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena, Nimbus Plaza, Mosaic Plaza, Oakshade Library, Willowshade Pavilion. \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena, Nimbus Plaza, Primrose Boulevard, Oakshade Library, Willowshade Pavilion. \nThe Cobalt Market has overlapping signal areas with Primrose Boulevard, Dragon’s Gate. \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with Knight’s Market, Nimbus Plaza, Primrose Boulevard, Flint Forge Quarter, Oakshade Library. \nThe Knight’s Market has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory, Flint Forge Quarter, Oakshade Library, Willowshade Pavilion. \nThe Nimbus Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory, Mosaic Plaza, Flint Forge Quarter, Oakshade Library, Dragon’s Gate. \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with Primrose Boulevard, Flint Forge Quarter, Oakshade Library. \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with Oakshade Library, Willowshade Pavilion, Dragon’s Gate. \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Oakshade Library, Dragon’s Gate. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Horizon Mall, Moonlit Promenade, Mosaic Plaza, Granite Plaza, Velvet Corner, Willowshade Pavilion, Westgate Station, Dragon’s Gate, Lighthouse Point, Sapphire Arena, Opal Theater, Yarrow Plaza, Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory, Rosewood Hall, Mosaic Plaza, Amber Plaza, Nimbus Plaza, Quartz District, Lighthouse Point, Sapphire Arena, Jade Fountain, Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with Twilight Harbor, Duskwood Park, Nimbus Plaza, Dragon’s Gate, Quartz District, Sapphire Arena, Opal Theater, Jade Fountain, Yarrow Plaza. \nThe Ironbridge Crossing has overlapping signal areas with Twilight Harbor, Horizon Mall, Moonlit Promenade, Mosaic Plaza, Velvet Corner, Amber Plaza, Duskwood Park, Dragon’s Gate, Quartz District, Sapphire Arena, Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Twilight Harbor has overlapping signal areas with Rosewood Hall, Granite Plaza, Amber Plaza, Westgate Station, Nimbus Plaza, Dragon’s Gate, Lighthouse Point, Sapphire Arena, Opal Theater, Yarrow Plaza, Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Rosewood Hall has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Westgate Station, Lighthouse Point, Opal Theater, Jade Fountain. \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza, Willowshade Pavilion, Lighthouse Point, Sapphire Arena, Jade Fountain. \nThe Moonlit Promenade has overlapping signal areas with Velvet Corner, Nimbus Plaza, Opal Theater, Jade Fountain, Yarrow Plaza. \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Westgate Station, Duskwood Park, Quartz District, Lighthouse Point, Sapphire Arena, Jade Fountain. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Amber Plaza, Westgate Station, Dragon’s Gate, Quartz District, Yarrow Plaza. \nThe Velvet Corner has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Westgate Station, Dragon’s Gate, Quartz District, Sapphire Arena, Jade Fountain, Yarrow Plaza. \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Dragon’s Gate, Quartz District, Opal Theater, Jade Fountain. \nThe Willowshade Pavilion has overlapping signal areas with Westgate Station, Duskwood Park, Nimbus Plaza, Dragon’s Gate, Quartz District, Sapphire Arena, Yarrow Plaza. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Dragon’s Gate. \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Nimbus Plaza, Lighthouse Point, Sapphire Arena, Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Nimbus Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Dragon’s Gate, Lighthouse Point, Sapphire Arena, Opal Theater, Yarrow Plaza. \nThe Dragon’s Gate has overlapping signal areas with Lighthouse Point. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater, Yarrow Plaza. \nThe Lighthouse Point has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater. \nThe Opal Theater has overlapping signal areas with Jade Fountain, Yarrow Plaza. \nThe Jade Fountain has overlapping signal areas with Maplewood Conservatory. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 24 major locations in the city: Evergreen Circle, Lighthouse Point, Echo Station, Flare Alley, Northwind Tower, Union Square Market, Lunar Pier, Horizon Mall, Dragon’s Gate, Nimbus Plaza, Temple Square, King’s Row, Sapphire Arena, Knight’s Market, Quartz District, Beacon Tower, Amber Plaza, Westgate Station, Skyline Gardens, Quarry Point, Ironbridge Crossing, Zenith Arena, Jasper Marina and Pennywhistle Arcade. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Evergreen Circle has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, Horizon Mall, Dragon’s Gate, Sapphire Arena, Westgate Station, Skyline Gardens, Quarry Point, Ironbridge Crossing, Zenith Arena, Jasper Marina, Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Lighthouse Point has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, Horizon Mall, Dragon’s Gate, Nimbus Plaza, King’s Row, Sapphire Arena, Quartz District, Beacon Tower, Amber Plaza, Jasper Marina. \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier, Dragon’s Gate, Temple Square, Sapphire Arena, Skyline Gardens, Ironbridge Crossing, Zenith Arena. \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, Lunar Pier, Horizon Mall, Sapphire Arena, Knight’s Market, Quartz District, Amber Plaza, Skyline Gardens, Zenith Arena. \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with Horizon Mall, Temple Square, Knight’s Market, Amber Plaza, Westgate Station, Skyline Gardens, Quarry Point, Zenith Arena, Jasper Marina. \nThe Union Square Market has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier, Horizon Mall, Dragon’s Gate, Nimbus Plaza, Temple Square, King’s Row, Beacon Tower, Amber Plaza, Ironbridge Crossing, Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Lunar Pier has overlapping signal areas with Horizon Mall, Dragon’s Gate, Sapphire Arena, Knight’s Market, Quartz District, Beacon Tower, Amber Plaza, Westgate Station, Quarry Point, Zenith Arena, Jasper Marina. \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Westgate Station, Skyline Gardens, Ironbridge Crossing, Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Dragon’s Gate has overlapping signal areas with Nimbus Plaza, Temple Square, Knight’s Market, Quartz District, Westgate Station, Skyline Gardens, Quarry Point, Zenith Arena, Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Nimbus Plaza has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Quartz District, Amber Plaza, Westgate Station, Ironbridge Crossing, Zenith Arena, Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Temple Square has overlapping signal areas with Quartz District, Beacon Tower, Westgate Station, Quarry Point, Zenith Arena, Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower, Amber Plaza, Ironbridge Crossing. \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with Quartz District. \nThe Knight’s Market has overlapping signal areas with Westgate Station, Quarry Point, Jasper Marina. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower, Amber Plaza, Zenith Arena. \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with Zenith Arena, Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Westgate Station, Skyline Gardens, Zenith Arena, Jasper Marina. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Ironbridge Crossing, Zenith Arena. \nThe Quarry Point has overlapping signal areas with Ironbridge Crossing. \nThe Ironbridge Crossing has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Zenith Arena has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Jasper Marina has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 24 major locations in the city: Ironbridge Crossing, Amber Plaza, Pennywhistle Arcade, Gilded Archway, Zenith Arena, Quarry Point, Copper Clock Square, Umbra Theater, Quartz District, Willowshade Pavilion, Riverstone Wharf, Nimbus Plaza, Azure Gardens, Flint Forge Quarter, Twilight Harbor, Knight’s Market, King’s Row, Northwind Tower, Dragon’s Gate, Mosaic Plaza, Temple Square, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Horizon Mall and Lunar Pier. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Ironbridge Crossing has overlapping signal areas with Amber Plaza, Pennywhistle Arcade, Quarry Point, Quartz District, Willowshade Pavilion, Riverstone Wharf, Nimbus Plaza, King’s Row, Northwind Tower, Mosaic Plaza, Temple Square, Lunar Pier. \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Quartz District, Willowshade Pavilion, Riverstone Wharf, Nimbus Plaza, Flint Forge Quarter, Dragon’s Gate, Mosaic Plaza, Lunar Pier. \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Riverstone Wharf, Flint Forge Quarter, Twilight Harbor, King’s Row, Mosaic Plaza, Horizon Mall, Lunar Pier. \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Copper Clock Square, Nimbus Plaza, Flint Forge Quarter, Twilight Harbor, Northwind Tower, Mosaic Plaza, Horizon Mall. \nThe Zenith Arena has overlapping signal areas with Quarry Point, Copper Clock Square, Umbra Theater, Willowshade Pavilion, Riverstone Wharf, Flint Forge Quarter, Knight’s Market, Northwind Tower, Lunar Pier. \nThe Quarry Point has overlapping signal areas with Quartz District, Riverstone Wharf, Dragon’s Gate, Mosaic Plaza, Horizon Mall. \nThe Copper Clock Square has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater, Quartz District, Flint Forge Quarter, Twilight Harbor, Knight’s Market, King’s Row, Temple Square. \nThe Umbra Theater has overlapping signal areas with Quartz District, Willowshade Pavilion, Nimbus Plaza, Azure Gardens, Twilight Harbor, Knight’s Market, Northwind Tower, Mosaic Plaza, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Riverstone Wharf, Nimbus Plaza, Azure Gardens, Twilight Harbor, Knight’s Market, Northwind Tower, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Willowshade Pavilion has overlapping signal areas with Riverstone Wharf, Nimbus Plaza, Azure Gardens, Flint Forge Quarter, Twilight Harbor, King’s Row, Mosaic Plaza, Temple Square, Horizon Mall. \nThe Riverstone Wharf has overlapping signal areas with Azure Gardens, Twilight Harbor, Knight’s Market, Northwind Tower, Horizon Mall. \nThe Nimbus Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Lunar Pier. \nThe Azure Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Dragon’s Gate, Mosaic Plaza, Horizon Mall. \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Horizon Mall, Lunar Pier. \nThe Twilight Harbor has overlapping signal areas with Knight’s Market, King’s Row, Northwind Tower, Dragon’s Gate, Temple Square, Horizon Mall, Lunar Pier. \nThe Knight’s Market has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Dragon’s Gate, Mosaic Plaza, Temple Square. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza, Horizon Mall. \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with Horizon Mall, Lunar Pier. \nThe Dragon’s Gate has overlapping signal areas with Temple Square, Lunar Pier. \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Horizon Mall. \nThe Temple Square has overlapping signal areas with Horizon Mall, Lunar Pier. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Horizon Mall. \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 24 major locations in the city: Shadowbridge Arcade, Granite Plaza, Maplewood Conservatory, Willowshade Pavilion, Echo Station, Mosaic Plaza, Oakshade Library, Twilight Harbor, Beacon Tower, Primrose Boulevard, Umbra Theater, Moonlit Promenade, Pennywhistle Arcade, Cobalt Market, Skyline Gardens, Dragon’s Gate, Jade Fountain, Brass Lantern Tavern, Azure Gardens, Opal Theater, Ironbridge Crossing, Duskwood Park, Knight’s Market and Gilded Archway. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Shadowbridge Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Echo Station, Mosaic Plaza, Twilight Harbor, Skyline Gardens, Jade Fountain, Brass Lantern Tavern, Azure Gardens, Opal Theater, Duskwood Park, Gilded Archway. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Oakshade Library, Twilight Harbor, Beacon Tower, Skyline Gardens, Dragon’s Gate, Azure Gardens, Duskwood Park, Knight’s Market. \nThe Maplewood Conservatory has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Mosaic Plaza, Oakshade Library, Twilight Harbor, Moonlit Promenade, Cobalt Market, Dragon’s Gate, Ironbridge Crossing, Knight’s Market. \nThe Willowshade Pavilion has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza, Oakshade Library, Beacon Tower, Primrose Boulevard, Moonlit Promenade, Cobalt Market, Skyline Gardens, Duskwood Park. \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza, Beacon Tower, Umbra Theater, Moonlit Promenade, Cobalt Market, Dragon’s Gate, Duskwood Park. \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Oakshade Library, Primrose Boulevard, Umbra Theater, Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Oakshade Library has overlapping signal areas with Twilight Harbor, Beacon Tower, Pennywhistle Arcade, Dragon’s Gate, Azure Gardens, Opal Theater. \nThe Twilight Harbor has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower, Umbra Theater, Moonlit Promenade, Pennywhistle Arcade, Dragon’s Gate, Jade Fountain, Opal Theater, Duskwood Park, Knight’s Market, Gilded Archway. \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater, Moonlit Promenade, Pennywhistle Arcade, Skyline Gardens, Dragon’s Gate, Azure Gardens, Opal Theater, Ironbridge Crossing, Gilded Archway. \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with Dragon’s Gate, Brass Lantern Tavern, Opal Theater, Ironbridge Crossing, Knight’s Market. \nThe Umbra Theater has overlapping signal areas with Dragon’s Gate, Jade Fountain, Ironbridge Crossing, Duskwood Park, Knight’s Market, Gilded Archway. \nThe Moonlit Promenade has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade, Skyline Gardens, Jade Fountain, Azure Gardens, Opal Theater, Ironbridge Crossing. \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Azure Gardens, Opal Theater, Ironbridge Crossing, Knight’s Market. \nThe Cobalt Market has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens, Dragon’s Gate, Opal Theater. \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Dragon’s Gate, Jade Fountain, Brass Lantern Tavern, Opal Theater, Gilded Archway. \nThe Dragon’s Gate has overlapping signal areas with Jade Fountain, Ironbridge Crossing, Knight’s Market, Gilded Archway. \nThe Jade Fountain has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Azure Gardens, Gilded Archway. \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater, Gilded Archway. \nThe Azure Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Ironbridge Crossing, Knight’s Market. \nThe Opal Theater has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park. \nThe Ironbridge Crossing has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park, Knight’s Market. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 24 major locations in the city: Quartz District, Flare Alley, Zenith Arena, Twilight Harbor, Beacon Tower, Lunar Pier, Temple Square, Flint Forge Quarter, Primrose Boulevard, Lighthouse Point, Granite Plaza, Evergreen Circle, Westgate Station, Pennywhistle Arcade, Silvercrest Observatory, Brass Lantern Tavern, Velvet Corner, Knight’s Market, Nimbus Plaza, Shadowbridge Arcade, Ironbridge Crossing, Quarry Point, Copper Clock Square and Amber Plaza. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Twilight Harbor, Lunar Pier, Primrose Boulevard, Silvercrest Observatory, Brass Lantern Tavern, Ironbridge Crossing, Quarry Point. \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Twilight Harbor, Beacon Tower, Temple Square, Lighthouse Point, Evergreen Circle, Pennywhistle Arcade, Velvet Corner, Quarry Point, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Zenith Arena has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier, Temple Square, Flint Forge Quarter, Primrose Boulevard, Granite Plaza, Pennywhistle Arcade, Velvet Corner, Ironbridge Crossing. \nThe Twilight Harbor has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier, Granite Plaza, Silvercrest Observatory, Knight’s Market, Ironbridge Crossing, Quarry Point. \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier, Flint Forge Quarter, Lighthouse Point, Brass Lantern Tavern, Knight’s Market, Nimbus Plaza, Shadowbridge Arcade, Ironbridge Crossing. \nThe Lunar Pier has overlapping signal areas with Temple Square, Primrose Boulevard, Lighthouse Point, Granite Plaza, Evergreen Circle, Pennywhistle Arcade, Silvercrest Observatory, Brass Lantern Tavern, Velvet Corner, Shadowbridge Arcade, Quarry Point, Copper Clock Square, Amber Plaza. \nThe Temple Square has overlapping signal areas with Evergreen Circle, Brass Lantern Tavern, Knight’s Market, Nimbus Plaza, Quarry Point, Copper Clock Square, Amber Plaza. \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Lighthouse Point, Granite Plaza, Silvercrest Observatory, Shadowbridge Arcade, Ironbridge Crossing, Amber Plaza. \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza, Evergreen Circle, Westgate Station, Knight’s Market, Ironbridge Crossing, Quarry Point, Amber Plaza. \nThe Lighthouse Point has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza, Westgate Station, Pennywhistle Arcade, Brass Lantern Tavern, Ironbridge Crossing, Copper Clock Square, Amber Plaza. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Evergreen Circle, Westgate Station, Pennywhistle Arcade, Silvercrest Observatory, Velvet Corner, Ironbridge Crossing. \nThe Evergreen Circle has overlapping signal areas with Velvet Corner, Shadowbridge Arcade, Quarry Point. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade, Copper Clock Square, Amber Plaza. \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory, Nimbus Plaza, Ironbridge Crossing, Amber Plaza. \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Knight’s Market, Shadowbridge Arcade, Quarry Point, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with Velvet Corner, Knight’s Market, Nimbus Plaza, Ironbridge Crossing, Amber Plaza. \nThe Velvet Corner has overlapping signal areas with Ironbridge Crossing. \nThe Knight’s Market has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade, Amber Plaza. \nThe Nimbus Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Ironbridge Crossing, Quarry Point. \nThe Shadowbridge Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Ironbridge Crossing. \nThe Ironbridge Crossing has overlapping signal areas with Quarry Point, Copper Clock Square, Amber Plaza. \nThe Quarry Point has overlapping signal areas with Amber Plaza. \nThe Copper Clock Square has overlapping signal areas with Amber Plaza. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 24 major locations in the city: Silvercrest Observatory, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Twilight Harbor, Shadowbridge Arcade, Moonlit Promenade, Westgate Station, Skyline Gardens, Jasper Marina, Willowshade Pavilion, Haven Docks, Rosewood Hall, Horizon Mall, Temple Square, Granite Plaza, Gilded Archway, Echo Station, Oakshade Library, Zenith Arena, Beacon Tower, Flint Forge Quarter, Duskwood Park, Mosaic Plaza, Azure Gardens and Lighthouse Point. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade, Moonlit Promenade, Westgate Station, Horizon Mall, Temple Square, Granite Plaza, Gilded Archway, Oakshade Library, Zenith Arena, Duskwood Park, Mosaic Plaza. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens, Haven Docks, Echo Station, Beacon Tower, Duskwood Park, Azure Gardens. \nThe Twilight Harbor has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade, Moonlit Promenade, Willowshade Pavilion, Haven Docks, Horizon Mall, Oakshade Library, Duskwood Park, Mosaic Plaza. \nThe Shadowbridge Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Rosewood Hall, Mosaic Plaza, Lighthouse Point. \nThe Moonlit Promenade has overlapping signal areas with Westgate Station, Skyline Gardens, Willowshade Pavilion, Rosewood Hall, Gilded Archway, Echo Station, Oakshade Library, Beacon Tower, Duskwood Park, Mosaic Plaza. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens, Jasper Marina, Rosewood Hall, Horizon Mall, Temple Square, Oakshade Library, Beacon Tower, Duskwood Park, Mosaic Plaza, Azure Gardens. \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Haven Docks, Horizon Mall, Temple Square, Gilded Archway, Mosaic Plaza. \nThe Jasper Marina has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Gilded Archway, Oakshade Library. \nThe Willowshade Pavilion has overlapping signal areas with Rosewood Hall, Temple Square, Granite Plaza, Beacon Tower, Flint Forge Quarter, Duskwood Park, Mosaic Plaza, Azure Gardens, Lighthouse Point. \nThe Haven Docks has overlapping signal areas with Rosewood Hall, Horizon Mall, Granite Plaza, Flint Forge Quarter, Duskwood Park, Mosaic Plaza, Azure Gardens, Lighthouse Point. \nThe Rosewood Hall has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway, Oakshade Library, Zenith Arena, Flint Forge Quarter, Duskwood Park, Mosaic Plaza, Lighthouse Point. \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza, Gilded Archway, Echo Station, Oakshade Library, Zenith Arena, Flint Forge Quarter, Duskwood Park, Mosaic Plaza. \nThe Temple Square has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower, Duskwood Park, Lighthouse Point. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway, Echo Station, Oakshade Library, Flint Forge Quarter, Azure Gardens, Lighthouse Point. \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Oakshade Library, Azure Gardens. \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with Zenith Arena, Beacon Tower, Duskwood Park. \nThe Oakshade Library has overlapping signal areas with Zenith Arena, Mosaic Plaza, Azure Gardens. \nThe Zenith Arena has overlapping signal areas with Flint Forge Quarter, Azure Gardens, Lighthouse Point. \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park, Lighthouse Point. \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza, Lighthouse Point. \nThe Azure Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Lighthouse Point. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 24 major locations in the city: Flint Forge Quarter, Flare Alley, Ironbridge Crossing, Copper Clock Square, Umbra Theater, Gilded Archway, Dragon’s Gate, Pennywhistle Arcade, Westgate Station, Horizon Mall, Quarry Point, Mosaic Plaza, Moonlit Promenade, Opal Theater, Duskwood Park, Echo Station, Northwind Tower, Yarrow Plaza, Zenith Arena, Maplewood Conservatory, Granite Plaza, Nimbus Plaza, Twilight Harbor and Skyline Gardens. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Ironbridge Crossing, Copper Clock Square, Dragon’s Gate, Horizon Mall, Quarry Point, Opal Theater, Yarrow Plaza, Zenith Arena, Skyline Gardens. \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater, Gilded Archway, Dragon’s Gate, Pennywhistle Arcade, Horizon Mall, Quarry Point, Moonlit Promenade, Northwind Tower, Yarrow Plaza, Nimbus Plaza. \nThe Ironbridge Crossing has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater, Gilded Archway, Dragon’s Gate, Horizon Mall, Moonlit Promenade, Opal Theater, Duskwood Park, Northwind Tower, Twilight Harbor, Skyline Gardens. \nThe Copper Clock Square has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater, Dragon’s Gate, Pennywhistle Arcade, Duskwood Park, Echo Station, Northwind Tower, Yarrow Plaza, Twilight Harbor. \nThe Umbra Theater has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway, Quarry Point, Moonlit Promenade, Opal Theater, Duskwood Park, Northwind Tower, Maplewood Conservatory, Granite Plaza, Nimbus Plaza. \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Dragon’s Gate, Westgate Station, Horizon Mall, Quarry Point, Opal Theater, Duskwood Park, Echo Station, Northwind Tower, Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Dragon’s Gate has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade, Westgate Station, Horizon Mall, Duskwood Park, Yarrow Plaza, Maplewood Conservatory, Twilight Harbor. \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Horizon Mall, Mosaic Plaza, Moonlit Promenade, Duskwood Park, Echo Station, Northwind Tower, Yarrow Plaza, Twilight Harbor. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, Yarrow Plaza, Maplewood Conservatory, Granite Plaza, Twilight Harbor. \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Moonlit Promenade, Northwind Tower, Zenith Arena, Maplewood Conservatory, Skyline Gardens. \nThe Quarry Point has overlapping signal areas with Moonlit Promenade, Opal Theater, Echo Station, Northwind Tower, Yarrow Plaza, Granite Plaza, Nimbus Plaza, Twilight Harbor. \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Moonlit Promenade, Opal Theater, Northwind Tower, Maplewood Conservatory, Granite Plaza. \nThe Moonlit Promenade has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, Nimbus Plaza, Twilight Harbor, Skyline Gardens. \nThe Opal Theater has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park, Echo Station, Yarrow Plaza, Twilight Harbor. \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, Yarrow Plaza, Zenith Arena, Granite Plaza. \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza, Twilight Harbor. \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with Zenith Arena, Twilight Harbor, Skyline Gardens. \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Twilight Harbor, Skyline Gardens. \nThe Zenith Arena has overlapping signal areas with Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Maplewood Conservatory has overlapping signal areas with Twilight Harbor. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Twilight Harbor. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 24 major locations in the city: Horizon Mall, Rosewood Hall, Flare Alley, Willowshade Pavilion, Zenith Arena, Twilight Harbor, Westgate Station, Sapphire Arena, Amber Plaza, Evergreen Circle, Oakshade Library, Beacon Tower, Granite Plaza, Primrose Boulevard, King’s Row, Lighthouse Point, Mosaic Plaza, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Quartz District, Jade Fountain, Maplewood Conservatory, Dragon’s Gate, Velvet Corner and Skyline Gardens. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Rosewood Hall, Flare Alley, Zenith Arena, Twilight Harbor, Westgate Station, Sapphire Arena, Oakshade Library, King’s Row, Lighthouse Point, Mosaic Plaza, Jade Fountain, Velvet Corner, Skyline Gardens. \nThe Rosewood Hall has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Oakshade Library, Granite Plaza, Primrose Boulevard, King’s Row, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Zenith Arena, Amber Plaza, Evergreen Circle, Granite Plaza, Primrose Boulevard, Lighthouse Point, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Jade Fountain, Maplewood Conservatory, Dragon’s Gate. \nThe Willowshade Pavilion has overlapping signal areas with Twilight Harbor, Evergreen Circle, Oakshade Library, Beacon Tower, Primrose Boulevard, Mosaic Plaza, Jade Fountain, Skyline Gardens. \nThe Zenith Arena has overlapping signal areas with Twilight Harbor, Evergreen Circle, Granite Plaza, King’s Row, Lighthouse Point, Mosaic Plaza, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Jade Fountain, Maplewood Conservatory, Dragon’s Gate. \nThe Twilight Harbor has overlapping signal areas with Westgate Station, Granite Plaza, Primrose Boulevard, Mosaic Plaza, Quartz District. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Amber Plaza, Oakshade Library, Beacon Tower, Primrose Boulevard, King’s Row, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Velvet Corner, Skyline Gardens. \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with Amber Plaza, Oakshade Library, Beacon Tower, King’s Row, Quartz District, Maplewood Conservatory, Velvet Corner. \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Evergreen Circle, Oakshade Library, Beacon Tower, Primrose Boulevard, Lighthouse Point, Mosaic Plaza, Jade Fountain, Maplewood Conservatory, Velvet Corner, Skyline Gardens. \nThe Evergreen Circle has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza, King’s Row, Dragon’s Gate. \nThe Oakshade Library has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower, Mosaic Plaza, Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza, Maplewood Conservatory, Dragon’s Gate. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Lighthouse Point, Mosaic Plaza, Quartz District, Velvet Corner, Skyline Gardens. \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with Quartz District, Maplewood Conservatory, Dragon’s Gate, Skyline Gardens. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral, Jade Fountain, Maplewood Conservatory, Dragon’s Gate, Velvet Corner, Skyline Gardens. \nThe Lighthouse Point has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Jade Fountain, Velvet Corner. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Maplewood Conservatory, Dragon’s Gate. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Maplewood Conservatory, Skyline Gardens. \nThe Jade Fountain has overlapping signal areas with Velvet Corner. \nThe Maplewood Conservatory has overlapping signal areas with Dragon’s Gate, Velvet Corner, Skyline Gardens. \nThe Dragon’s Gate has overlapping signal areas with Velvet Corner. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 24 major locations in the city: Haven Docks, Cobalt Market, Horizon Mall, Yarrow Plaza, Quartz District, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Dragon’s Gate, Amber Plaza, Oakshade Library, Jasper Marina, Silvercrest Observatory, Shadowbridge Arcade, Pennywhistle Arcade, Ironbridge Crossing, Willowshade Pavilion, Azure Gardens, Beacon Tower, Riverstone Wharf, Twilight Harbor, Umbra Theater, Temple Square, Gilded Archway, Moonlit Promenade and Brass Lantern Tavern. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Haven Docks has overlapping signal areas with Cobalt Market, Yarrow Plaza, Quartz District, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Dragon’s Gate, Oakshade Library, Shadowbridge Arcade, Willowshade Pavilion, Azure Gardens, Beacon Tower, Umbra Theater, Temple Square, Gilded Archway, Moonlit Promenade, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Cobalt Market has overlapping signal areas with Horizon Mall, Dragon’s Gate, Shadowbridge Arcade, Pennywhistle Arcade, Ironbridge Crossing, Willowshade Pavilion, Azure Gardens, Umbra Theater. \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Jasper Marina, Silvercrest Observatory, Shadowbridge Arcade, Pennywhistle Arcade, Azure Gardens, Beacon Tower, Temple Square, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral, Amber Plaza, Pennywhistle Arcade, Azure Gardens, Beacon Tower, Umbra Theater, Temple Square, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral, Dragon’s Gate, Amber Plaza, Silvercrest Observatory, Pennywhistle Arcade, Ironbridge Crossing, Riverstone Wharf, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Amber Plaza, Oakshade Library, Jasper Marina, Shadowbridge Arcade, Willowshade Pavilion, Beacon Tower, Riverstone Wharf, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Dragon’s Gate has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina, Ironbridge Crossing, Willowshade Pavilion, Azure Gardens, Beacon Tower, Riverstone Wharf, Umbra Theater, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Oakshade Library, Jasper Marina, Pennywhistle Arcade, Beacon Tower, Riverstone Wharf, Gilded Archway, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Oakshade Library has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade, Pennywhistle Arcade, Willowshade Pavilion, Temple Square. \nThe Jasper Marina has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade, Ironbridge Crossing, Twilight Harbor, Umbra Theater, Temple Square, Gilded Archway. \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade, Ironbridge Crossing, Riverstone Wharf, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Shadowbridge Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Ironbridge Crossing, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Azure Gardens, Beacon Tower, Umbra Theater. \nThe Ironbridge Crossing has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Riverstone Wharf, Temple Square, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Willowshade Pavilion has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower, Riverstone Wharf, Temple Square, Moonlit Promenade, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Azure Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Twilight Harbor, Umbra Theater, Temple Square, Gilded Archway. \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Riverstone Wharf has overlapping signal areas with Twilight Harbor, Umbra Theater, Temple Square. \nThe Twilight Harbor has overlapping signal areas with Temple Square. \nThe Umbra Theater has overlapping signal areas with Temple Square, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Temple Square has overlapping signal areas with Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Moonlit Promenade, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Duskwood Park, Twilight Harbor, Quarry Point, Quartz District, Amber Plaza, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Nimbus Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Duskwood Park, Northwind Tower, Amber Plaza, Granite Plaza, Primrose Boulevard, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with Zenith Arena, Westgate Station, Lighthouse Point, Rosewood Hall, Northwind Tower, Granite Plaza, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Zenith Arena has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Riverstone Wharf, Duskwood Park, Twilight Harbor, Pennywhistle Arcade, Copper Clock Square, Horizon Mall, Northwind Tower. \nThe Willowshade Pavilion has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, Riverstone Wharf, Lighthouse Point, Rosewood Hall, Northwind Tower, Amber Plaza, Haven Docks. \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park, Ironbridge Crossing, Horizon Mall, Granite Plaza, Moonlit Promenade, Haven Docks. \nThe Riverstone Wharf has overlapping signal areas with Westgate Station, Duskwood Park, Twilight Harbor, Copper Clock Square, Horizon Mall, Northwind Tower, Quartz District, Amber Plaza, Granite Plaza, Haven Docks. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade, Lighthouse Point, Northwind Tower, Granite Plaza. \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Twilight Harbor, Pennywhistle Arcade, Quarry Point, Rosewood Hall, Horizon Mall, Northwind Tower, Granite Plaza, Primrose Boulevard, Moonlit Promenade, Haven Docks. \nThe Twilight Harbor has overlapping signal areas with Ironbridge Crossing, Rosewood Hall, Horizon Mall, Northwind Tower, Quartz District, Haven Docks. \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Quarry Point, Lighthouse Point, Rosewood Hall, Horizon Mall, Quartz District, Primrose Boulevard, Haven Docks. \nThe Quarry Point has overlapping signal areas with Ironbridge Crossing, Copper Clock Square, Lighthouse Point, Amber Plaza, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Ironbridge Crossing has overlapping signal areas with Copper Clock Square, Rosewood Hall, Northwind Tower, Granite Plaza, Primrose Boulevard, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Copper Clock Square has overlapping signal areas with Rosewood Hall, Horizon Mall, Quartz District, Haven Docks. \nThe Lighthouse Point has overlapping signal areas with Rosewood Hall, Horizon Mall, Northwind Tower, Quartz District, Haven Docks. \nThe Rosewood Hall has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, Quartz District, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, Quartz District. \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with Amber Plaza, Primrose Boulevard, Moonlit Promenade, Haven Docks. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Amber Plaza, Granite Plaza. \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza, Haven Docks. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Moonlit Promenade, Haven Docks. \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with Haven Docks. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 24 major locations in the city: Sapphire Arena, Haven Docks, Flare Alley, Northwind Tower, Lunar Pier, Primrose Boulevard, Westgate Station, Union Square Market, Velvet Corner, Moonlit Promenade, Riverstone Wharf, Horizon Mall, Flint Forge Quarter, Umbra Theater, Shadowbridge Arcade, Amber Plaza, Granite Plaza, Maplewood Conservatory, Beacon Tower, Ironbridge Crossing, Quartz District, Silvercrest Observatory, Oakshade Library and Jade Fountain. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with Moonlit Promenade, Shadowbridge Arcade, Granite Plaza. \nThe Haven Docks has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, Union Square Market, Horizon Mall, Amber Plaza, Ironbridge Crossing, Jade Fountain. \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier, Primrose Boulevard, Westgate Station, Riverstone Wharf, Horizon Mall, Flint Forge Quarter, Amber Plaza, Beacon Tower, Ironbridge Crossing, Quartz District, Silvercrest Observatory, Jade Fountain. \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier, Primrose Boulevard, Westgate Station, Union Square Market, Umbra Theater, Quartz District, Oakshade Library. \nThe Lunar Pier has overlapping signal areas with Primrose Boulevard, Velvet Corner, Moonlit Promenade, Riverstone Wharf, Horizon Mall, Amber Plaza, Granite Plaza, Silvercrest Observatory, Oakshade Library. \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with Westgate Station, Riverstone Wharf, Shadowbridge Arcade, Maplewood Conservatory, Beacon Tower, Ironbridge Crossing, Quartz District, Silvercrest Observatory, Jade Fountain. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Moonlit Promenade, Granite Plaza, Jade Fountain. \nThe Union Square Market has overlapping signal areas with Velvet Corner, Moonlit Promenade, Riverstone Wharf, Flint Forge Quarter, Umbra Theater, Amber Plaza, Beacon Tower, Ironbridge Crossing. \nThe Velvet Corner has overlapping signal areas with Moonlit Promenade, Riverstone Wharf, Amber Plaza, Maplewood Conservatory, Ironbridge Crossing, Quartz District, Silvercrest Observatory, Oakshade Library. \nThe Moonlit Promenade has overlapping signal areas with Riverstone Wharf, Shadowbridge Arcade, Beacon Tower, Quartz District, Silvercrest Observatory, Oakshade Library, Jade Fountain. \nThe Riverstone Wharf has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater, Amber Plaza, Granite Plaza, Maplewood Conservatory, Quartz District, Silvercrest Observatory. \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade, Maplewood Conservatory, Ironbridge Crossing, Oakshade Library. \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade, Maplewood Conservatory, Beacon Tower, Quartz District, Jade Fountain. \nThe Umbra Theater has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade, Granite Plaza, Maplewood Conservatory, Beacon Tower, Ironbridge Crossing, Oakshade Library. \nThe Shadowbridge Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Amber Plaza, Beacon Tower, Ironbridge Crossing, Jade Fountain. \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Quartz District, Oakshade Library, Jade Fountain. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Ironbridge Crossing, Silvercrest Observatory, Jade Fountain. \nThe Maplewood Conservatory has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower, Quartz District, Silvercrest Observatory, Jade Fountain. \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with Quartz District. \nThe Ironbridge Crossing has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory, Oakshade Library, Jade Fountain. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Oakshade Library, Jade Fountain. \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with Jade Fountain. \nThe Oakshade Library has overlapping signal areas with Jade Fountain. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 24 major locations in the city: Velvet Corner, Primrose Boulevard, Twilight Harbor, Duskwood Park, Nimbus Plaza, Jade Fountain, Beacon Tower, Horizon Mall, Lunar Pier, Haven Docks, Northwind Tower, Rosewood Hall, Jasper Marina, Lighthouse Point, Maplewood Conservatory, Temple Square, Echo Station, Gilded Archway, Dragon’s Gate, Granite Plaza, Quartz District, Moonlit Promenade, Union Square Market and Azure Gardens. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Velvet Corner has overlapping signal areas with Twilight Harbor, Duskwood Park, Nimbus Plaza, Beacon Tower, Horizon Mall, Northwind Tower, Maplewood Conservatory, Temple Square, Gilded Archway, Dragon’s Gate, Granite Plaza. \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park, Jade Fountain, Horizon Mall, Northwind Tower, Rosewood Hall, Lighthouse Point, Maplewood Conservatory, Dragon’s Gate, Quartz District, Azure Gardens. \nThe Twilight Harbor has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park, Beacon Tower, Horizon Mall, Lunar Pier, Haven Docks, Jasper Marina, Gilded Archway. \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Horizon Mall, Northwind Tower, Rosewood Hall, Jasper Marina, Maplewood Conservatory, Temple Square, Echo Station, Gilded Archway, Union Square Market. \nThe Nimbus Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Horizon Mall, Lunar Pier, Rosewood Hall, Lighthouse Point, Maplewood Conservatory, Temple Square, Echo Station, Dragon’s Gate, Quartz District, Azure Gardens. \nThe Jade Fountain has overlapping signal areas with Horizon Mall, Lunar Pier, Lighthouse Point, Maplewood Conservatory, Union Square Market. \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with Horizon Mall, Jasper Marina, Maplewood Conservatory, Temple Square, Echo Station, Dragon’s Gate, Granite Plaza, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Haven Docks, Northwind Tower, Rosewood Hall, Jasper Marina, Lighthouse Point, Maplewood Conservatory, Temple Square, Quartz District, Moonlit Promenade, Union Square Market, Azure Gardens. \nThe Lunar Pier has overlapping signal areas with Haven Docks, Jasper Marina, Echo Station, Gilded Archway, Granite Plaza, Quartz District, Moonlit Promenade, Azure Gardens. \nThe Haven Docks has overlapping signal areas with Rosewood Hall, Dragon’s Gate, Granite Plaza, Quartz District, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with Rosewood Hall, Jasper Marina, Maplewood Conservatory, Gilded Archway, Azure Gardens. \nThe Rosewood Hall has overlapping signal areas with Maplewood Conservatory, Echo Station, Gilded Archway, Granite Plaza. \nThe Jasper Marina has overlapping signal areas with Lighthouse Point, Temple Square, Gilded Archway, Dragon’s Gate, Quartz District, Azure Gardens. \nThe Lighthouse Point has overlapping signal areas with Maplewood Conservatory, Temple Square, Echo Station, Gilded Archway, Quartz District. \nThe Maplewood Conservatory has overlapping signal areas with Union Square Market. \nThe Temple Square has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway, Dragon’s Gate, Quartz District, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway. \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Dragon’s Gate has overlapping signal areas with Quartz District, Moonlit Promenade, Union Square Market. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Quartz District. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 24 major locations in the city: Copper Clock Square, Temple Square, Quarry Point, Skyline Gardens, Pennywhistle Arcade, Lunar Pier, King’s Row, Flare Alley, Nimbus Plaza, Zenith Arena, Quartz District, Dragon’s Gate, Shadowbridge Arcade, Maplewood Conservatory, Yarrow Plaza, Rosewood Hall, Moonlit Promenade, Duskwood Park, Azure Gardens, Haven Docks, Primrose Boulevard, Lighthouse Point, Oakshade Library and Umbra Theater. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Copper Clock Square has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens, Nimbus Plaza, Yarrow Plaza, Azure Gardens, Haven Docks, Umbra Theater. \nThe Temple Square has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens, Lunar Pier, Flare Alley, Zenith Arena, Dragon’s Gate, Yarrow Plaza, Rosewood Hall, Moonlit Promenade, Haven Docks. \nThe Quarry Point has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade, Lunar Pier, King’s Row, Flare Alley, Yarrow Plaza, Duskwood Park, Primrose Boulevard, Lighthouse Point, Umbra Theater. \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier, Flare Alley, Nimbus Plaza, Maplewood Conservatory, Rosewood Hall, Moonlit Promenade, Duskwood Park, Haven Docks, Primrose Boulevard, Umbra Theater. \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Zenith Arena, Duskwood Park, Haven Docks, Umbra Theater. \nThe Lunar Pier has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Nimbus Plaza, Zenith Arena, Rosewood Hall, Moonlit Promenade, Duskwood Park, Lighthouse Point, Umbra Theater. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Zenith Arena, Quartz District, Dragon’s Gate, Yarrow Plaza, Duskwood Park, Azure Gardens, Primrose Boulevard, Umbra Theater. \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Dragon’s Gate, Shadowbridge Arcade, Maplewood Conservatory, Yarrow Plaza, Rosewood Hall, Duskwood Park, Lighthouse Point, Umbra Theater. \nThe Nimbus Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Quartz District, Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Zenith Arena has overlapping signal areas with Quartz District, Shadowbridge Arcade, Yarrow Plaza, Haven Docks, Primrose Boulevard, Oakshade Library, Umbra Theater. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Rosewood Hall, Haven Docks, Lighthouse Point. \nThe Dragon’s Gate has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, Rosewood Hall, Duskwood Park, Azure Gardens, Haven Docks, Primrose Boulevard, Lighthouse Point. \nThe Shadowbridge Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Azure Gardens, Haven Docks, Lighthouse Point. \nThe Maplewood Conservatory has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, Moonlit Promenade, Azure Gardens, Haven Docks, Lighthouse Point. \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Rosewood Hall, Duskwood Park, Azure Gardens, Haven Docks, Oakshade Library, Umbra Theater. \nThe Rosewood Hall has overlapping signal areas with Azure Gardens, Primrose Boulevard, Lighthouse Point, Umbra Theater. \nThe Moonlit Promenade has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park, Azure Gardens, Haven Docks, Oakshade Library. \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Azure Gardens, Haven Docks, Primrose Boulevard, Oakshade Library, Umbra Theater. \nThe Azure Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater. \nThe Haven Docks has overlapping signal areas with Lighthouse Point. \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with Lighthouse Point, Oakshade Library, Umbra Theater. \nThe Lighthouse Point has overlapping signal areas with Oakshade Library. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 24 major locations in the city: Duskwood Park, Flint Forge Quarter, Quarry Point, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Granite Plaza, Evergreen Circle, Union Square Market, Westgate Station, Copper Clock Square, Azure Gardens, Skyline Gardens, Amber Plaza, Lighthouse Point, Maplewood Conservatory, Beacon Tower, Lunar Pier, King’s Row, Twilight Harbor, Rosewood Hall, Silvercrest Observatory, Echo Station, Brass Lantern Tavern, Gilded Archway and Pennywhistle Arcade. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Quarry Point, Skyline Gardens, Amber Plaza, Lighthouse Point, Maplewood Conservatory, Beacon Tower, King’s Row, Echo Station, Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral, Westgate Station, Maplewood Conservatory, Twilight Harbor, Rosewood Hall, Brass Lantern Tavern, Gilded Archway. \nThe Quarry Point has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral, Granite Plaza, Evergreen Circle, Union Square Market, Westgate Station, Skyline Gardens, Lighthouse Point, Maplewood Conservatory, Beacon Tower, Twilight Harbor, Echo Station, Gilded Archway. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Westgate Station, Copper Clock Square, Azure Gardens, Amber Plaza, Lighthouse Point, King’s Row, Rosewood Hall, Silvercrest Observatory, Brass Lantern Tavern, Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Evergreen Circle, Union Square Market, Westgate Station, Azure Gardens, Lighthouse Point, Maplewood Conservatory, Beacon Tower, Lunar Pier, Gilded Archway. \nThe Evergreen Circle has overlapping signal areas with Union Square Market, Amber Plaza, Lunar Pier, King’s Row, Gilded Archway, Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Union Square Market has overlapping signal areas with Lighthouse Point, Maplewood Conservatory, Beacon Tower, Lunar Pier, Twilight Harbor. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Copper Clock Square, Amber Plaza, Maplewood Conservatory, Beacon Tower, Lunar Pier, Brass Lantern Tavern, Gilded Archway. \nThe Copper Clock Square has overlapping signal areas with Amber Plaza, Lunar Pier, Twilight Harbor, Rosewood Hall, Silvercrest Observatory, Brass Lantern Tavern, Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Azure Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens, Lighthouse Point, Lunar Pier, King’s Row, Echo Station. \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Maplewood Conservatory, Beacon Tower, Lunar Pier, King’s Row, Rosewood Hall, Silvercrest Observatory, Echo Station, Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower, Lunar Pier, King’s Row, Twilight Harbor, Echo Station. \nThe Lighthouse Point has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Echo Station, Gilded Archway. \nThe Maplewood Conservatory has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier, Twilight Harbor, Rosewood Hall, Brass Lantern Tavern, Gilded Archway. \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Silvercrest Observatory, Echo Station, Gilded Archway. \nThe Lunar Pier has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Echo Station, Gilded Archway. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Rosewood Hall, Echo Station. \nThe Twilight Harbor has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Gilded Archway. \nThe Rosewood Hall has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory, Echo Station, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station. \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Pennywhistle Arcade. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 24 major locations in the city: Opal Theater, Yarrow Plaza, Skyline Gardens, Dragon’s Gate, Velvet Corner, Umbra Theater, Horizon Mall, Amber Plaza, Ironbridge Crossing, Lunar Pier, Moonlit Promenade, King’s Row, Granite Plaza, Haven Docks, Quartz District, Echo Station, Azure Gardens, Temple Square, Mosaic Plaza, Gilded Archway, Copper Clock Square, Jasper Marina, Flint Forge Quarter and Pennywhistle Arcade. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Opal Theater has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, Velvet Corner, Umbra Theater, Horizon Mall, Amber Plaza, Ironbridge Crossing, Lunar Pier, Moonlit Promenade, Quartz District, Temple Square, Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens, Dragon’s Gate, Velvet Corner, Horizon Mall, Amber Plaza, Ironbridge Crossing, Mosaic Plaza, Gilded Archway, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Dragon’s Gate, Velvet Corner, Horizon Mall, Ironbridge Crossing, Moonlit Promenade, Gilded Archway, Copper Clock Square, Jasper Marina, Flint Forge Quarter, Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Dragon’s Gate has overlapping signal areas with Velvet Corner, Horizon Mall, Amber Plaza, Ironbridge Crossing, Lunar Pier, Moonlit Promenade, King’s Row, Quartz District, Echo Station, Mosaic Plaza, Gilded Archway, Copper Clock Square, Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Velvet Corner has overlapping signal areas with Horizon Mall, Haven Docks, Quartz District, Echo Station, Azure Gardens, Copper Clock Square, Flint Forge Quarter, Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Umbra Theater has overlapping signal areas with Amber Plaza, Quartz District, Copper Clock Square, Jasper Marina, Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier, Moonlit Promenade, King’s Row, Haven Docks, Azure Gardens. \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Ironbridge Crossing, Lunar Pier, Moonlit Promenade, Granite Plaza, Quartz District, Azure Gardens, Gilded Archway, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Ironbridge Crossing has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier, Moonlit Promenade, Quartz District, Echo Station, Azure Gardens, Temple Square, Mosaic Plaza. \nThe Lunar Pier has overlapping signal areas with Moonlit Promenade, Haven Docks, Temple Square, Gilded Archway, Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Moonlit Promenade has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Granite Plaza, Quartz District, Echo Station, Gilded Archway, Copper Clock Square, Jasper Marina, Flint Forge Quarter. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Haven Docks, Echo Station, Mosaic Plaza, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Haven Docks, Azure Gardens, Temple Square, Mosaic Plaza, Flint Forge Quarter, Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Haven Docks has overlapping signal areas with Quartz District, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway, Flint Forge Quarter, Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Azure Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina, Flint Forge Quarter. \nThe Temple Square has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza, Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway. \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina. \nThe Jasper Marina has overlapping signal areas with Flint Forge Quarter, Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 24 major locations in the city: Zenith Arena, Evergreen Circle, Lighthouse Point, Moonlit Promenade, Azure Gardens, Maplewood Conservatory, Pennywhistle Arcade, Nimbus Plaza, Brass Lantern Tavern, Flint Forge Quarter, King’s Row, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Horizon Mall, Northwind Tower, Velvet Corner, Amber Plaza, Shadowbridge Arcade, Lunar Pier, Knight’s Market, Cobalt Market, Haven Docks, Flare Alley, Ironbridge Crossing and Granite Plaza. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Zenith Arena has overlapping signal areas with Evergreen Circle, Moonlit Promenade, Azure Gardens, Pennywhistle Arcade, Brass Lantern Tavern, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Shadowbridge Arcade, Lunar Pier, Haven Docks, Flare Alley, Ironbridge Crossing, Granite Plaza. \nThe Evergreen Circle has overlapping signal areas with Lighthouse Point, Moonlit Promenade, Azure Gardens, Maplewood Conservatory, Brass Lantern Tavern, King’s Row, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Horizon Mall, Northwind Tower, Velvet Corner, Amber Plaza, Lunar Pier, Haven Docks, Granite Plaza. \nThe Lighthouse Point has overlapping signal areas with Maplewood Conservatory, Brass Lantern Tavern, Flint Forge Quarter, Northwind Tower, Amber Plaza, Knight’s Market, Flare Alley. \nThe Moonlit Promenade has overlapping signal areas with Azure Gardens, Maplewood Conservatory, Pennywhistle Arcade, Nimbus Plaza, Flint Forge Quarter, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Velvet Corner, Lunar Pier, Cobalt Market, Flare Alley. \nThe Azure Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, King’s Row, Amber Plaza, Shadowbridge Arcade, Cobalt Market, Haven Docks, Flare Alley. \nThe Maplewood Conservatory has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade, King’s Row, Horizon Mall, Velvet Corner, Cobalt Market. \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Flint Forge Quarter, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Shadowbridge Arcade, Knight’s Market. \nThe Nimbus Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Horizon Mall, Northwind Tower, Shadowbridge Arcade, Haven Docks. \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with Flint Forge Quarter, Horizon Mall, Velvet Corner, Shadowbridge Arcade, Haven Docks, Ironbridge Crossing, Granite Plaza. \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral, Horizon Mall, Northwind Tower, Velvet Corner, Amber Plaza, Knight’s Market, Cobalt Market. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral, Horizon Mall, Cobalt Market, Haven Docks, Flare Alley, Ironbridge Crossing, Granite Plaza. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Horizon Mall, Shadowbridge Arcade. \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, Velvet Corner, Knight’s Market, Haven Docks. \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with Velvet Corner, Amber Plaza, Lunar Pier, Flare Alley, Ironbridge Crossing. \nThe Velvet Corner has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade, Lunar Pier, Knight’s Market. \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Knight’s Market, Ironbridge Crossing, Granite Plaza. \nThe Shadowbridge Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Knight’s Market, Cobalt Market, Haven Docks, Flare Alley, Ironbridge Crossing. \nThe Lunar Pier has overlapping signal areas with Flare Alley, Granite Plaza. \nThe Knight’s Market has overlapping signal areas with Haven Docks. \nThe Cobalt Market has overlapping signal areas with Flare Alley, Ironbridge Crossing. \nThe Haven Docks has overlapping signal areas with Flare Alley, Ironbridge Crossing. \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Ironbridge Crossing, Granite Plaza. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 24 major locations in the city: Amber Plaza, Knight’s Market, Union Square Market, Beacon Tower, Northwind Tower, Granite Plaza, Azure Gardens, Jade Fountain, Opal Theater, Horizon Mall, Ironbridge Crossing, Rosewood Hall, Velvet Corner, Quarry Point, King’s Row, Primrose Boulevard, Duskwood Park, Gilded Archway, Moonlit Promenade, Lunar Pier, Twilight Harbor, Copper Clock Square, Ivory Spire Cathedral and Shadowbridge Arcade. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Union Square Market, Northwind Tower, Opal Theater, Ironbridge Crossing, King’s Row, Primrose Boulevard, Moonlit Promenade, Twilight Harbor, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Knight’s Market has overlapping signal areas with Union Square Market, Granite Plaza, Azure Gardens, Opal Theater, Quarry Point, King’s Row, Primrose Boulevard, Duskwood Park, Lunar Pier, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Union Square Market has overlapping signal areas with Primrose Boulevard, Duskwood Park, Moonlit Promenade, Lunar Pier, Twilight Harbor, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Shadowbridge Arcade. \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza, Azure Gardens, Jade Fountain, Horizon Mall, Rosewood Hall, Quarry Point, Primrose Boulevard, Duskwood Park, Moonlit Promenade, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with Rosewood Hall, Quarry Point, Primrose Boulevard, Moonlit Promenade, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater, Horizon Mall, Rosewood Hall, Gilded Archway, Twilight Harbor. \nThe Azure Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Horizon Mall, Ironbridge Crossing, Quarry Point, King’s Row, Primrose Boulevard, Duskwood Park, Gilded Archway, Lunar Pier, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Jade Fountain has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater, Horizon Mall, Ironbridge Crossing, Velvet Corner, Gilded Archway, Lunar Pier, Copper Clock Square, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Opal Theater has overlapping signal areas with Horizon Mall, Quarry Point, Moonlit Promenade, Lunar Pier, Copper Clock Square, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Shadowbridge Arcade. \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Primrose Boulevard, Lunar Pier, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Ironbridge Crossing has overlapping signal areas with Rosewood Hall, Primrose Boulevard, Moonlit Promenade, Twilight Harbor, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Rosewood Hall has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway, Moonlit Promenade, Lunar Pier. \nThe Velvet Corner has overlapping signal areas with Quarry Point, King’s Row, Lunar Pier, Twilight Harbor. \nThe Quarry Point has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Primrose Boulevard, Gilded Archway, Moonlit Promenade, Twilight Harbor, Shadowbridge Arcade. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Primrose Boulevard, Lunar Pier, Twilight Harbor, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with Moonlit Promenade, Twilight Harbor, Shadowbridge Arcade. \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier, Copper Clock Square, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Copper Clock Square, Shadowbridge Arcade. \nThe Moonlit Promenade has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier, Twilight Harbor, Copper Clock Square, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Shadowbridge Arcade. \nThe Lunar Pier has overlapping signal areas with Copper Clock Square, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Shadowbridge Arcade. \nThe Twilight Harbor has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade. \nThe Copper Clock Square has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",
