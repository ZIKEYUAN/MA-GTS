  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 5 major locations in the city: Umbra Theater, Rosewood Hall, King’s Row, Shadowbridge Arcade and Duskwood Park. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Umbra Theater has overlapping signal areas with Rosewood Hall, Duskwood Park. \nThe Rosewood Hall has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade. \nThe Shadowbridge Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",
