  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 21 major locations in the city: Moonlit Promenade, Lighthouse Point, Velvet Corner, Amber Plaza, Umbra Theater, Cobalt Market, Flare Alley, Westgate Station, Mosaic Plaza, Opal Theater, Riverstone Wharf, Ironbridge Crossing, King’s Row, Quarry Point, Nimbus Plaza, Yarrow Plaza, Jade Fountain, Copper Clock Square, Northwind Tower, Knight’s Market and Haven Docks. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Moonlit Promenade has overlapping signal areas with Lighthouse Point, Velvet Corner, Cobalt Market, Mosaic Plaza, Ironbridge Crossing, King’s Row, Nimbus Plaza, Yarrow Plaza, Copper Clock Square, Knight’s Market. \nThe Lighthouse Point has overlapping signal areas with Ironbridge Crossing, King’s Row, Quarry Point, Yarrow Plaza, Northwind Tower, Knight’s Market. \nThe Velvet Corner has overlapping signal areas with Amber Plaza, Riverstone Wharf, Jade Fountain, Northwind Tower, Knight’s Market, Haven Docks. \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Cobalt Market, Flare Alley, Riverstone Wharf, Quarry Point, Nimbus Plaza, Haven Docks. \nThe Umbra Theater has overlapping signal areas with Cobalt Market, Flare Alley, Mosaic Plaza, Quarry Point, Copper Clock Square, Northwind Tower, Knight’s Market. \nThe Cobalt Market has overlapping signal areas with Westgate Station, Mosaic Plaza, Opal Theater, Riverstone Wharf, Ironbridge Crossing, King’s Row, Yarrow Plaza, Copper Clock Square, Northwind Tower, Knight’s Market, Haven Docks. \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza, Opal Theater, Riverstone Wharf, King’s Row, Yarrow Plaza, Jade Fountain, Copper Clock Square, Knight’s Market, Haven Docks. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Ironbridge Crossing, Quarry Point, Yarrow Plaza, Northwind Tower, Knight’s Market. \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater, Riverstone Wharf, Ironbridge Crossing. \nThe Opal Theater has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Yarrow Plaza, Copper Clock Square, Northwind Tower. \nThe Riverstone Wharf has overlapping signal areas with Ironbridge Crossing, Yarrow Plaza, Copper Clock Square, Haven Docks. \nThe Ironbridge Crossing has overlapping signal areas with Quarry Point, Northwind Tower, Haven Docks. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Knight’s Market. \nThe Quarry Point has overlapping signal areas with Nimbus Plaza, Jade Fountain, Copper Clock Square, Northwind Tower, Knight’s Market. \nThe Nimbus Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Jade Fountain, Knight’s Market, Haven Docks. \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, Haven Docks. \nThe Jade Fountain has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, Haven Docks. \nThe Knight’s Market has overlapping signal areas with Haven Docks. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 21 major locations in the city: Opal Theater, King’s Row, Quartz District, Umbra Theater, Silvercrest Observatory, Horizon Mall, Northwind Tower, Mosaic Plaza, Riverstone Wharf, Skyline Gardens, Yarrow Plaza, Maplewood Conservatory, Union Square Market, Shadowbridge Arcade, Azure Gardens, Ironbridge Crossing, Copper Clock Square, Beacon Tower, Twilight Harbor, Brass Lantern Tavern and Amber Plaza. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Opal Theater has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Umbra Theater, Northwind Tower, Mosaic Plaza, Riverstone Wharf, Maplewood Conservatory, Ironbridge Crossing, Copper Clock Square, Amber Plaza. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater, Horizon Mall, Northwind Tower, Mosaic Plaza, Maplewood Conservatory, Union Square Market, Beacon Tower, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater, Silvercrest Observatory, Horizon Mall, Skyline Gardens, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Umbra Theater has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, Maplewood Conservatory, Ironbridge Crossing, Twilight Harbor, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with Horizon Mall, Mosaic Plaza, Maplewood Conservatory, Union Square Market, Beacon Tower, Brass Lantern Tavern, Amber Plaza. \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza, Riverstone Wharf, Skyline Gardens, Union Square Market, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza, Skyline Gardens, Maplewood Conservatory, Azure Gardens, Ironbridge Crossing, Copper Clock Square, Brass Lantern Tavern, Amber Plaza. \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Riverstone Wharf, Skyline Gardens, Yarrow Plaza, Maplewood Conservatory, Azure Gardens, Copper Clock Square, Twilight Harbor. \nThe Riverstone Wharf has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, Shadowbridge Arcade, Azure Gardens, Ironbridge Crossing. \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Union Square Market, Shadowbridge Arcade, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Maplewood Conservatory, Shadowbridge Arcade, Azure Gardens, Ironbridge Crossing, Twilight Harbor, Amber Plaza. \nThe Maplewood Conservatory has overlapping signal areas with Azure Gardens, Ironbridge Crossing, Twilight Harbor. \nThe Union Square Market has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade, Ironbridge Crossing, Copper Clock Square, Beacon Tower, Twilight Harbor. \nThe Shadowbridge Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Amber Plaza. \nThe Azure Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Copper Clock Square, Twilight Harbor, Amber Plaza. \nThe Ironbridge Crossing has overlapping signal areas with Copper Clock Square, Beacon Tower, Twilight Harbor. \nThe Copper Clock Square has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower, Brass Lantern Tavern, Amber Plaza. \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with Amber Plaza. \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with Amber Plaza. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 21 major locations in the city: Oakshade Library, Union Square Market, Shadowbridge Arcade, Opal Theater, Willowshade Pavilion, Knight’s Market, Maplewood Conservatory, Gilded Archway, Brass Lantern Tavern, Rosewood Hall, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Ironbridge Crossing, Primrose Boulevard, Pennywhistle Arcade, Silvercrest Observatory, Velvet Corner, Echo Station, Sapphire Arena, Flare Alley, Nimbus Plaza and Umbra Theater. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Oakshade Library has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater, Willowshade Pavilion, Maplewood Conservatory, Gilded Archway, Brass Lantern Tavern, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Ironbridge Crossing, Primrose Boulevard, Silvercrest Observatory, Nimbus Plaza. \nThe Union Square Market has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater, Knight’s Market, Maplewood Conservatory, Brass Lantern Tavern, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Ironbridge Crossing, Pennywhistle Arcade, Velvet Corner, Sapphire Arena, Nimbus Plaza. \nThe Shadowbridge Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater, Velvet Corner, Sapphire Arena, Nimbus Plaza. \nThe Opal Theater has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Knight’s Market, Brass Lantern Tavern, Rosewood Hall, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Ironbridge Crossing. \nThe Willowshade Pavilion has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Rosewood Hall, Pennywhistle Arcade, Silvercrest Observatory, Sapphire Arena, Umbra Theater. \nThe Knight’s Market has overlapping signal areas with Maplewood Conservatory, Gilded Archway, Brass Lantern Tavern, Rosewood Hall, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Silvercrest Observatory, Velvet Corner, Nimbus Plaza. \nThe Maplewood Conservatory has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway, Brass Lantern Tavern, Rosewood Hall, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Primrose Boulevard, Pennywhistle Arcade, Echo Station, Flare Alley. \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Ironbridge Crossing, Primrose Boulevard, Sapphire Arena, Nimbus Plaza. \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with Rosewood Hall, Silvercrest Observatory, Flare Alley, Umbra Theater. \nThe Rosewood Hall has overlapping signal areas with Ironbridge Crossing, Silvercrest Observatory, Velvet Corner, Sapphire Arena, Flare Alley. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Ironbridge Crossing, Sapphire Arena, Nimbus Plaza. \nThe Ironbridge Crossing has overlapping signal areas with Primrose Boulevard, Velvet Corner, Echo Station. \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade, Velvet Corner, Echo Station, Sapphire Arena, Flare Alley. \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory, Flare Alley, Nimbus Plaza, Umbra Theater. \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with Flare Alley. \nThe Velvet Corner has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station, Sapphire Arena, Nimbus Plaza. \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena, Nimbus Plaza, Umbra Theater. \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with Flare Alley. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 21 major locations in the city: Primrose Boulevard, Mosaic Plaza, Flare Alley, Maplewood Conservatory, Beacon Tower, Northwind Tower, Pennywhistle Arcade, Lighthouse Point, Haven Docks, Quartz District, Silvercrest Observatory, Copper Clock Square, Flint Forge Quarter, Temple Square, Echo Station, Oakshade Library, Yarrow Plaza, Azure Gardens, Twilight Harbor, Shadowbridge Arcade and Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza, Pennywhistle Arcade, Haven Docks, Silvercrest Observatory, Flint Forge Quarter, Oakshade Library, Yarrow Plaza, Azure Gardens. \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Haven Docks, Silvercrest Observatory, Copper Clock Square, Flint Forge Quarter, Temple Square, Oakshade Library, Shadowbridge Arcade. \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower, Pennywhistle Arcade, Silvercrest Observatory, Copper Clock Square, Flint Forge Quarter, Azure Gardens, Shadowbridge Arcade, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Maplewood Conservatory has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower, Northwind Tower, Haven Docks, Silvercrest Observatory, Yarrow Plaza, Twilight Harbor, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade, Copper Clock Square, Temple Square, Oakshade Library. \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with Lighthouse Point, Flint Forge Quarter, Echo Station, Oakshade Library. \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Lighthouse Point, Haven Docks, Copper Clock Square, Flint Forge Quarter, Yarrow Plaza, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Lighthouse Point has overlapping signal areas with Haven Docks, Quartz District, Temple Square, Echo Station, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Haven Docks has overlapping signal areas with Quartz District, Silvercrest Observatory, Echo Station, Oakshade Library, Yarrow Plaza, Azure Gardens, Shadowbridge Arcade, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory, Temple Square, Yarrow Plaza, Shadowbridge Arcade, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with Temple Square, Twilight Harbor. \nThe Copper Clock Square has overlapping signal areas with Flint Forge Quarter, Echo Station, Yarrow Plaza. \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Temple Square, Echo Station, Oakshade Library, Azure Gardens, Twilight Harbor, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Temple Square has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station, Oakshade Library, Twilight Harbor, Shadowbridge Arcade. \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with Oakshade Library, Yarrow Plaza, Azure Gardens, Shadowbridge Arcade. \nThe Oakshade Library has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, Twilight Harbor. \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Azure Gardens, Shadowbridge Arcade, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Azure Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Twilight Harbor has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference.

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 21 major locations in the city: Rosewood Hall, Beacon Tower, Temple Square, Shadowbridge Arcade, Umbra Theater, Flint Forge Quarter, Willowshade Pavilion, King’s Row, Cobalt Market, Gilded Archway, Twilight Harbor, Quarry Point, Ironbridge Crossing, Pennywhistle Arcade, Velvet Corner, Lighthouse Point, Lunar Pier, Evergreen Circle, Opal Theater, Riverstone Wharf and Haven Docks. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Rosewood Hall has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, King’s Row, Cobalt Market, Ironbridge Crossing, Haven Docks. \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with Temple Square, Umbra Theater, Cobalt Market, Gilded Archway, Pennywhistle Arcade, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Temple Square has overlapping signal areas with Cobalt Market, Gilded Archway, Twilight Harbor, Opal Theater. \nThe Shadowbridge Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater, Flint Forge Quarter, King’s Row, Cobalt Market, Gilded Archway, Quarry Point, Ironbridge Crossing, Pennywhistle Arcade, Velvet Corner, Lighthouse Point, Lunar Pier, Evergreen Circle, Opal Theater. \nThe Umbra Theater has overlapping signal areas with Flint Forge Quarter, Willowshade Pavilion, King’s Row, Twilight Harbor, Pennywhistle Arcade, Velvet Corner, Lunar Pier, Evergreen Circle, Opal Theater. \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway, Quarry Point, Ironbridge Crossing, Lighthouse Point, Opal Theater, Riverstone Wharf, Haven Docks. \nThe Willowshade Pavilion has overlapping signal areas with Twilight Harbor, Quarry Point, Pennywhistle Arcade, Evergreen Circle, Opal Theater. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Cobalt Market, Ironbridge Crossing, Pennywhistle Arcade, Velvet Corner, Opal Theater, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Cobalt Market has overlapping signal areas with Twilight Harbor, Lighthouse Point, Opal Theater, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Velvet Corner, Lunar Pier, Evergreen Circle, Haven Docks. \nThe Twilight Harbor has overlapping signal areas with Quarry Point, Lunar Pier, Riverstone Wharf, Haven Docks. \nThe Quarry Point has overlapping signal areas with Ironbridge Crossing, Pennywhistle Arcade, Lunar Pier. \nThe Ironbridge Crossing has overlapping signal areas with Lighthouse Point, Lunar Pier, Haven Docks. \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Velvet Corner, Lighthouse Point, Evergreen Circle, Opal Theater. \nThe Velvet Corner has overlapping signal areas with Lighthouse Point, Evergreen Circle, Haven Docks. \nThe Lighthouse Point has overlapping signal areas with Evergreen Circle, Opal Theater, Haven Docks. \nThe Lunar Pier has overlapping signal areas with Haven Docks. \nThe Evergreen Circle has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater. \nThe Opal Theater has overlapping signal areas with Riverstone Wharf, Haven Docks. \nThe Riverstone Wharf has overlapping signal areas with Haven Docks. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 21 major locations in the city: Mosaic Plaza, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Quartz District, Echo Station, Pennywhistle Arcade, Nimbus Plaza, Duskwood Park, King’s Row, Westgate Station, Knight’s Market, Beacon Tower, Ironbridge Crossing, Flint Forge Quarter, Cobalt Market, Maplewood Conservatory, Rosewood Hall, Riverstone Wharf, Haven Docks, Dragon’s Gate, Union Square Market and Azure Gardens. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral, Quartz District, Pennywhistle Arcade, Westgate Station, Knight’s Market, Dragon’s Gate, Azure Gardens. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Quartz District, Pennywhistle Arcade, King’s Row, Cobalt Market, Riverstone Wharf, Azure Gardens. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade, Nimbus Plaza, King’s Row, Knight’s Market, Cobalt Market, Riverstone Wharf, Azure Gardens. \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Knight’s Market, Beacon Tower, Ironbridge Crossing, Maplewood Conservatory, Riverstone Wharf, Union Square Market, Azure Gardens. \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Nimbus Plaza, Duskwood Park, Flint Forge Quarter, Cobalt Market, Maplewood Conservatory, Rosewood Hall, Haven Docks, Union Square Market, Azure Gardens. \nThe Nimbus Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Westgate Station, Flint Forge Quarter, Cobalt Market, Rosewood Hall, Riverstone Wharf, Haven Docks, Azure Gardens. \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Ironbridge Crossing, Maplewood Conservatory, Dragon’s Gate, Union Square Market. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Knight’s Market, Beacon Tower, Cobalt Market, Maplewood Conservatory, Rosewood Hall, Union Square Market, Azure Gardens. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower, Ironbridge Crossing, Riverstone Wharf, Haven Docks, Union Square Market, Azure Gardens. \nThe Knight’s Market has overlapping signal areas with Cobalt Market, Haven Docks, Dragon’s Gate. \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with Ironbridge Crossing, Flint Forge Quarter, Cobalt Market, Rosewood Hall, Haven Docks, Azure Gardens. \nThe Ironbridge Crossing has overlapping signal areas with Flint Forge Quarter, Cobalt Market, Maplewood Conservatory, Union Square Market. \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Cobalt Market, Maplewood Conservatory, Azure Gardens. \nThe Cobalt Market has overlapping signal areas with Riverstone Wharf, Haven Docks, Dragon’s Gate, Azure Gardens. \nThe Maplewood Conservatory has overlapping signal areas with Dragon’s Gate, Union Square Market. \nThe Rosewood Hall has overlapping signal areas with Riverstone Wharf, Haven Docks, Azure Gardens. \nThe Haven Docks has overlapping signal areas with Dragon’s Gate. \nThe Dragon’s Gate has overlapping signal areas with Azure Gardens. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Lighthouse Point has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Horizon Mall, Nimbus Plaza, Flare Alley, Yarrow Plaza, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Primrose Boulevard, Northwind Tower, Knight’s Market, Echo Station. \nThe Maplewood Conservatory has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Silvercrest Observatory, Horizon Mall, Nimbus Plaza, Primrose Boulevard, Copper Clock Square, Flint Forge Quarter, Northwind Tower, Knight’s Market, Jade Fountain. \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with Cobalt Market, Yarrow Plaza, Flint Forge Quarter, Echo Station, Quartz District, Oakshade Library. \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with Horizon Mall, Nimbus Plaza, Flare Alley, Primrose Boulevard, Northwind Tower, Oakshade Library. \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Flare Alley, Yarrow Plaza, Temple Square, Copper Clock Square, Northwind Tower, Echo Station, Quartz District, Sapphire Arena. \nThe Nimbus Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Temple Square, Primrose Boulevard, Echo Station, Jade Fountain, Sapphire Arena. \nThe Cobalt Market has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Temple Square, Primrose Boulevard, Northwind Tower, Knight’s Market, Oakshade Library. \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral, Primrose Boulevard, Flint Forge Quarter, Oakshade Library. \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Primrose Boulevard, Northwind Tower, Echo Station. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Primrose Boulevard, Copper Clock Square, Echo Station, Quartz District, Jade Fountain. \nThe Temple Square has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, Echo Station. \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with Copper Clock Square, Flint Forge Quarter, Knight’s Market, Jade Fountain. \nThe Copper Clock Square has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station, Sapphire Arena, Oakshade Library. \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, Jade Fountain, Sapphire Arena, Oakshade Library. \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station, Quartz District, Oakshade Library. \nThe Knight’s Market has overlapping signal areas with Quartz District, Jade Fountain. \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with Oakshade Library. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Jade Fountain, Sapphire Arena. \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with Oakshade Library. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference.

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 21 major locations in the city: Riverstone Wharf, Zenith Arena, Echo Station, Gilded Archway, Westgate Station, Pennywhistle Arcade, Twilight Harbor, King’s Row, Willowshade Pavilion, Quartz District, Opal Theater, Yarrow Plaza, Beacon Tower, Maplewood Conservatory, Ironbridge Crossing, Velvet Corner, Oakshade Library, Lighthouse Point, Umbra Theater, Quarry Point and Flare Alley. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Riverstone Wharf has overlapping signal areas with Zenith Arena, Twilight Harbor, King’s Row, Opal Theater, Maplewood Conservatory, Ironbridge Crossing, Velvet Corner, Oakshade Library, Quarry Point. \nThe Zenith Arena has overlapping signal areas with Westgate Station, Pennywhistle Arcade, Twilight Harbor, King’s Row, Willowshade Pavilion, Opal Theater, Yarrow Plaza, Beacon Tower, Ironbridge Crossing, Quarry Point, Flare Alley. \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway, Westgate Station, Pennywhistle Arcade, Twilight Harbor, King’s Row, Willowshade Pavilion, Opal Theater, Yarrow Plaza. \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade, Twilight Harbor, Willowshade Pavilion, Quartz District, Opal Theater, Yarrow Plaza, Beacon Tower, Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade, King’s Row, Yarrow Plaza, Flare Alley. \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Twilight Harbor, Quartz District, Yarrow Plaza, Maplewood Conservatory, Ironbridge Crossing, Lighthouse Point, Umbra Theater, Quarry Point. \nThe Twilight Harbor has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater, Yarrow Plaza, Maplewood Conservatory, Velvet Corner, Lighthouse Point, Quarry Point. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Yarrow Plaza, Maplewood Conservatory, Ironbridge Crossing, Oakshade Library, Lighthouse Point. \nThe Willowshade Pavilion has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater, Beacon Tower, Oakshade Library, Umbra Theater, Quarry Point, Flare Alley. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater, Beacon Tower, Lighthouse Point, Quarry Point. \nThe Opal Theater has overlapping signal areas with Lighthouse Point, Quarry Point. \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower, Lighthouse Point, Quarry Point. \nThe Maplewood Conservatory has overlapping signal areas with Ironbridge Crossing, Velvet Corner, Lighthouse Point. \nThe Ironbridge Crossing has overlapping signal areas with Velvet Corner, Oakshade Library, Lighthouse Point, Flare Alley. \nThe Velvet Corner has overlapping signal areas with Oakshade Library, Flare Alley. \nThe Oakshade Library has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater, Quarry Point. \nThe Lighthouse Point has overlapping signal areas with Flare Alley. \nThe Umbra Theater has overlapping signal areas with Quarry Point. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 21 major locations in the city: Silvercrest Observatory, Yarrow Plaza, Primrose Boulevard, Copper Clock Square, Horizon Mall, Opal Theater, Jade Fountain, Flint Forge Quarter, Umbra Theater, Maplewood Conservatory, Nimbus Plaza, Haven Docks, Quartz District, King’s Row, Knight’s Market, Union Square Market, Dragon’s Gate, Lunar Pier, Temple Square, Beacon Tower and Northwind Tower. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with Copper Clock Square, Jade Fountain, Flint Forge Quarter, Maplewood Conservatory, Haven Docks, Quartz District, Lunar Pier, Northwind Tower. \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Copper Clock Square, Jade Fountain, Flint Forge Quarter, Maplewood Conservatory, Knight’s Market, Lunar Pier, Northwind Tower. \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with Copper Clock Square, Haven Docks, Quartz District, Union Square Market, Dragon’s Gate, Northwind Tower. \nThe Copper Clock Square has overlapping signal areas with Nimbus Plaza, King’s Row, Union Square Market, Temple Square. \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater, Maplewood Conservatory, Quartz District, King’s Row, Dragon’s Gate, Temple Square, Beacon Tower, Northwind Tower. \nThe Opal Theater has overlapping signal areas with Jade Fountain, King’s Row, Union Square Market, Lunar Pier. \nThe Jade Fountain has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater, Maplewood Conservatory, Nimbus Plaza, Haven Docks, Quartz District, Dragon’s Gate, Beacon Tower, Northwind Tower. \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater, Nimbus Plaza, Haven Docks, Quartz District, Knight’s Market, Lunar Pier, Beacon Tower. \nThe Umbra Theater has overlapping signal areas with Maplewood Conservatory, Nimbus Plaza, Quartz District, King’s Row, Temple Square. \nThe Maplewood Conservatory has overlapping signal areas with Nimbus Plaza, Haven Docks, King’s Row, Dragon’s Gate, Beacon Tower. \nThe Nimbus Plaza has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Union Square Market, Dragon’s Gate, Temple Square, Northwind Tower. \nThe Haven Docks has overlapping signal areas with Knight’s Market, Beacon Tower, Northwind Tower. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Temple Square, Beacon Tower, Northwind Tower. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Knight’s Market, Union Square Market, Dragon’s Gate, Temple Square, Beacon Tower, Northwind Tower. \nThe Knight’s Market has overlapping signal areas with Dragon’s Gate, Temple Square. \nThe Union Square Market has overlapping signal areas with Dragon’s Gate, Lunar Pier. \nThe Dragon’s Gate has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower. \nThe Lunar Pier has overlapping signal areas with Temple Square, Northwind Tower. \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 21 major locations in the city: Sapphire Arena, Amber Plaza, Flare Alley, Jasper Marina, Rosewood Hall, Horizon Mall, Riverstone Wharf, Quartz District, Flint Forge Quarter, Yarrow Plaza, Lunar Pier, Lighthouse Point, Echo Station, Oakshade Library, Knight’s Market, Mosaic Plaza, Pennywhistle Arcade, Jade Fountain, Primrose Boulevard, Gilded Archway and Duskwood Park. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with Flare Alley, Rosewood Hall, Quartz District, Lunar Pier, Knight’s Market, Pennywhistle Arcade, Jade Fountain, Gilded Archway. \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina, Flint Forge Quarter, Yarrow Plaza, Lunar Pier, Lighthouse Point, Echo Station, Oakshade Library, Knight’s Market, Gilded Archway. \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Rosewood Hall, Horizon Mall, Riverstone Wharf, Flint Forge Quarter, Yarrow Plaza, Lunar Pier, Oakshade Library, Knight’s Market, Jade Fountain, Duskwood Park. \nThe Jasper Marina has overlapping signal areas with Lighthouse Point, Echo Station, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Rosewood Hall has overlapping signal areas with Riverstone Wharf, Quartz District, Flint Forge Quarter, Yarrow Plaza, Lunar Pier, Mosaic Plaza. \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Riverstone Wharf, Lighthouse Point, Echo Station, Oakshade Library, Pennywhistle Arcade, Duskwood Park. \nThe Riverstone Wharf has overlapping signal areas with Quartz District, Yarrow Plaza, Oakshade Library, Knight’s Market, Mosaic Plaza, Primrose Boulevard, Gilded Archway, Duskwood Park. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, Duskwood Park. \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier, Oakshade Library, Knight’s Market, Mosaic Plaza, Pennywhistle Arcade, Gilded Archway. \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Lighthouse Point, Oakshade Library, Knight’s Market, Jade Fountain. \nThe Lunar Pier has overlapping signal areas with Lighthouse Point, Echo Station, Oakshade Library, Mosaic Plaza, Pennywhistle Arcade, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Lighthouse Point has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station, Knight’s Market, Mosaic Plaza, Pennywhistle Arcade, Jade Fountain, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Oakshade Library has overlapping signal areas with Knight’s Market, Mosaic Plaza, Jade Fountain. \nThe Knight’s Market has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway. \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Primrose Boulevard, Gilded Archway. \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Jade Fountain, Primrose Boulevard, Gilded Archway, Duskwood Park. \nThe Jade Fountain has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park. \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 21 major locations in the city: Flare Alley, Duskwood Park, Riverstone Wharf, Jade Fountain, Maplewood Conservatory, Horizon Mall, Opal Theater, Willowshade Pavilion, Union Square Market, Primrose Boulevard, Brass Lantern Tavern, King’s Row, Echo Station, Velvet Corner, Northwind Tower, Temple Square, Umbra Theater, Jasper Marina, Yarrow Plaza, Oakshade Library and Amber Plaza. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Maplewood Conservatory, Union Square Market, King’s Row, Echo Station, Temple Square, Jasper Marina, Oakshade Library. \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Riverstone Wharf, Union Square Market, Primrose Boulevard, King’s Row, Echo Station, Umbra Theater, Yarrow Plaza. \nThe Riverstone Wharf has overlapping signal areas with Horizon Mall, Primrose Boulevard, Brass Lantern Tavern, King’s Row, Echo Station, Velvet Corner, Northwind Tower, Temple Square, Umbra Theater, Jasper Marina, Yarrow Plaza, Amber Plaza. \nThe Jade Fountain has overlapping signal areas with Maplewood Conservatory, Union Square Market. \nThe Maplewood Conservatory has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Primrose Boulevard, Brass Lantern Tavern, Echo Station, Northwind Tower, Umbra Theater, Yarrow Plaza, Oakshade Library, Amber Plaza. \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater, Willowshade Pavilion, Union Square Market, King’s Row, Echo Station, Velvet Corner, Temple Square, Umbra Theater, Yarrow Plaza, Amber Plaza. \nThe Opal Theater has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station, Velvet Corner, Temple Square, Umbra Theater, Jasper Marina, Yarrow Plaza, Oakshade Library. \nThe Willowshade Pavilion has overlapping signal areas with Union Square Market, Brass Lantern Tavern, Echo Station, Temple Square, Umbra Theater, Jasper Marina. \nThe Union Square Market has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Velvet Corner, Northwind Tower, Temple Square, Umbra Theater, Amber Plaza. \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, King’s Row, Jasper Marina, Yarrow Plaza. \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station, Northwind Tower, Umbra Theater. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Velvet Corner, Northwind Tower, Temple Square, Jasper Marina, Oakshade Library. \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, Jasper Marina, Oakshade Library. \nThe Velvet Corner has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater, Yarrow Plaza. \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with Temple Square, Jasper Marina, Oakshade Library. \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Oakshade Library, Amber Plaza. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 21 major locations in the city: Moonlit Promenade, Quartz District, Temple Square, Cobalt Market, Westgate Station, Quarry Point, Brass Lantern Tavern, King’s Row, Zenith Arena, Beacon Tower, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Jade Fountain, Jasper Marina, Granite Plaza, Twilight Harbor, Amber Plaza, Northwind Tower, Flare Alley, Copper Clock Square, Riverstone Wharf and Willowshade Pavilion. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Moonlit Promenade has overlapping signal areas with Quartz District, Quarry Point, Zenith Arena, Beacon Tower, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Amber Plaza, Willowshade Pavilion. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Cobalt Market, Quarry Point, King’s Row, Zenith Arena, Beacon Tower, Northwind Tower. \nThe Temple Square has overlapping signal areas with Cobalt Market, Brass Lantern Tavern, King’s Row, Beacon Tower, Jasper Marina, Twilight Harbor, Amber Plaza, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Cobalt Market has overlapping signal areas with Westgate Station, Quarry Point, Zenith Arena, Beacon Tower, Jasper Marina, Amber Plaza, Northwind Tower, Flare Alley, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Quarry Point, King’s Row, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Granite Plaza, Flare Alley. \nThe Quarry Point has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower, Northwind Tower, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral, Jade Fountain, Granite Plaza, Twilight Harbor, Amber Plaza, Northwind Tower, Flare Alley, Willowshade Pavilion. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Jade Fountain, Jasper Marina, Twilight Harbor. \nThe Zenith Arena has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral, Jasper Marina, Granite Plaza, Twilight Harbor, Amber Plaza, Flare Alley, Copper Clock Square, Willowshade Pavilion. \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral, Jade Fountain, Jasper Marina, Amber Plaza, Northwind Tower, Riverstone Wharf, Willowshade Pavilion. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, Copper Clock Square, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Jade Fountain has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina, Twilight Harbor, Northwind Tower, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Jasper Marina has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza, Twilight Harbor, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Twilight Harbor, Flare Alley, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Twilight Harbor has overlapping signal areas with Flare Alley, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Copper Clock Square. \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with Flare Alley, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Copper Clock Square, Willowshade Pavilion. \nThe Copper Clock Square has overlapping signal areas with Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Riverstone Wharf has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 21 major locations in the city: Northwind Tower, Azure Gardens, Jade Fountain, Lunar Pier, Willowshade Pavilion, Sapphire Arena, Mosaic Plaza, Twilight Harbor, Primrose Boulevard, Beacon Tower, Gilded Archway, Union Square Market, Oakshade Library, Zenith Arena, Brass Lantern Tavern, Temple Square, Quartz District, King’s Row, Umbra Theater, Copper Clock Square and Knight’s Market. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with Jade Fountain, Primrose Boulevard, Gilded Archway, Union Square Market, Oakshade Library, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Azure Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier, Willowshade Pavilion, Sapphire Arena, Twilight Harbor, Primrose Boulevard, Oakshade Library, Brass Lantern Tavern, Quartz District, King’s Row, Umbra Theater, Copper Clock Square, Knight’s Market. \nThe Jade Fountain has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier, Sapphire Arena, Twilight Harbor, Primrose Boulevard, Beacon Tower, Union Square Market, Oakshade Library, Temple Square. \nThe Lunar Pier has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Mosaic Plaza, Beacon Tower, Oakshade Library, Brass Lantern Tavern, Umbra Theater, Copper Clock Square, Knight’s Market. \nThe Willowshade Pavilion has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena, Mosaic Plaza, Beacon Tower, Gilded Archway, Union Square Market, Oakshade Library, Copper Clock Square, Knight’s Market. \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with Twilight Harbor, Primrose Boulevard, Beacon Tower, Oakshade Library, Zenith Arena, Temple Square, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway, Zenith Arena, Brass Lantern Tavern, King’s Row, Umbra Theater, Knight’s Market. \nThe Twilight Harbor has overlapping signal areas with Primrose Boulevard, Gilded Archway, Oakshade Library, Temple Square, King’s Row. \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower, Union Square Market, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with Union Square Market, Zenith Arena, Temple Square, Quartz District, Knight’s Market. \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Umbra Theater. \nThe Union Square Market has overlapping signal areas with Oakshade Library, Zenith Arena, Brass Lantern Tavern, Temple Square, Quartz District, Copper Clock Square, Knight’s Market. \nThe Oakshade Library has overlapping signal areas with Temple Square, King’s Row, Knight’s Market. \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater. \nThe Temple Square has overlapping signal areas with Knight’s Market. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater, Copper Clock Square. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater, Copper Clock Square, Knight’s Market. \nThe Umbra Theater has overlapping signal areas with Knight’s Market. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 21 major locations in the city: Gilded Archway, Zenith Arena, Yarrow Plaza, Beacon Tower, Jasper Marina, Lunar Pier, Brass Lantern Tavern, Westgate Station, Riverstone Wharf, Willowshade Pavilion, Flare Alley, Velvet Corner, Lighthouse Point, Nimbus Plaza, Skyline Gardens, Amber Plaza, Quartz District, Copper Clock Square, Cobalt Market, Haven Docks and Silvercrest Observatory. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Zenith Arena, Jasper Marina, Velvet Corner, Lighthouse Point, Nimbus Plaza, Amber Plaza, Copper Clock Square, Haven Docks. \nThe Zenith Arena has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier, Brass Lantern Tavern, Willowshade Pavilion, Flare Alley, Lighthouse Point, Nimbus Plaza, Skyline Gardens, Copper Clock Square, Haven Docks, Silvercrest Observatory. \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Westgate Station, Riverstone Wharf, Willowshade Pavilion, Velvet Corner, Copper Clock Square, Cobalt Market. \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Willowshade Pavilion, Flare Alley, Amber Plaza, Quartz District, Cobalt Market. \nThe Jasper Marina has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Riverstone Wharf, Flare Alley, Velvet Corner, Lighthouse Point, Quartz District, Haven Docks. \nThe Lunar Pier has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Riverstone Wharf, Willowshade Pavilion, Flare Alley, Skyline Gardens, Amber Plaza, Copper Clock Square, Cobalt Market. \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Quartz District. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Riverstone Wharf, Velvet Corner, Nimbus Plaza, Amber Plaza, Cobalt Market, Haven Docks, Silvercrest Observatory. \nThe Riverstone Wharf has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Amber Plaza, Cobalt Market. \nThe Willowshade Pavilion has overlapping signal areas with Flare Alley, Velvet Corner, Lighthouse Point, Nimbus Plaza, Amber Plaza, Cobalt Market, Silvercrest Observatory. \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Nimbus Plaza, Skyline Gardens, Amber Plaza, Copper Clock Square, Cobalt Market, Silvercrest Observatory. \nThe Velvet Corner has overlapping signal areas with Quartz District, Copper Clock Square, Cobalt Market, Haven Docks. \nThe Lighthouse Point has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens, Cobalt Market, Haven Docks. \nThe Nimbus Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Amber Plaza. \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory. \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Quartz District, Cobalt Market. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Cobalt Market, Silvercrest Observatory. \nThe Copper Clock Square has overlapping signal areas with Cobalt Market, Haven Docks, Silvercrest Observatory. \nThe Cobalt Market has overlapping signal areas with Haven Docks, Silvercrest Observatory. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 21 major locations in the city: Oakshade Library, Amber Plaza, Quartz District, King’s Row, Willowshade Pavilion, Maplewood Conservatory, Shadowbridge Arcade, Westgate Station, Zenith Arena, Ironbridge Crossing, Gilded Archway, Nimbus Plaza, Twilight Harbor, Velvet Corner, Skyline Gardens, Rosewood Hall, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Echo Station, Dragon’s Gate, Brass Lantern Tavern and Silvercrest Observatory. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Oakshade Library has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Shadowbridge Arcade, Ironbridge Crossing, Velvet Corner, Rosewood Hall, Echo Station, Silvercrest Observatory. \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Quartz District, Willowshade Pavilion, Maplewood Conservatory, Shadowbridge Arcade, Westgate Station, Ironbridge Crossing, Nimbus Plaza, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Dragon’s Gate. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Willowshade Pavilion, Maplewood Conservatory, Shadowbridge Arcade, Westgate Station, Nimbus Plaza, Twilight Harbor, Skyline Gardens, Brass Lantern Tavern, Silvercrest Observatory. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Zenith Arena, Nimbus Plaza, Skyline Gardens, Echo Station, Silvercrest Observatory. \nThe Willowshade Pavilion has overlapping signal areas with Ironbridge Crossing, Velvet Corner, Brass Lantern Tavern, Silvercrest Observatory. \nThe Maplewood Conservatory has overlapping signal areas with Westgate Station, Ironbridge Crossing, Nimbus Plaza, Twilight Harbor, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Dragon’s Gate, Silvercrest Observatory. \nThe Shadowbridge Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Westgate Station, Nimbus Plaza, Skyline Gardens, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Brass Lantern Tavern, Silvercrest Observatory. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Zenith Arena, Ironbridge Crossing, Gilded Archway, Rosewood Hall, Echo Station, Dragon’s Gate, Brass Lantern Tavern, Silvercrest Observatory. \nThe Zenith Arena has overlapping signal areas with Twilight Harbor, Rosewood Hall, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Ironbridge Crossing has overlapping signal areas with Nimbus Plaza, Rosewood Hall. \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Nimbus Plaza, Twilight Harbor, Rosewood Hall, Echo Station, Dragon’s Gate, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Nimbus Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Twilight Harbor, Rosewood Hall, Echo Station, Dragon’s Gate, Brass Lantern Tavern, Silvercrest Observatory. \nThe Twilight Harbor has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens, Dragon’s Gate, Silvercrest Observatory. \nThe Velvet Corner has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory. \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Rosewood Hall, Echo Station. \nThe Rosewood Hall has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station, Dragon’s Gate. \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with Dragon’s Gate, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Dragon’s Gate has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Silvercrest Observatory. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 21 major locations in the city: Silvercrest Observatory, Primrose Boulevard, Brass Lantern Tavern, Jade Fountain, Flint Forge Quarter, Yarrow Plaza, Westgate Station, Lunar Pier, Northwind Tower, Quarry Point, Maplewood Conservatory, Opal Theater, Cobalt Market, Duskwood Park, Copper Clock Square, Quartz District, King’s Row, Mosaic Plaza, Gilded Archway, Velvet Corner and Rosewood Hall. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with Primrose Boulevard, Brass Lantern Tavern, Flint Forge Quarter, Westgate Station, Lunar Pier, Opal Theater, Duskwood Park, Gilded Archway, Velvet Corner. \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Westgate Station, Quarry Point, King’s Row, Mosaic Plaza, Velvet Corner, Rosewood Hall. \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with Flint Forge Quarter, Yarrow Plaza, Lunar Pier, Northwind Tower, Cobalt Market, Duskwood Park, Copper Clock Square, King’s Row, Mosaic Plaza, Velvet Corner. \nThe Jade Fountain has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, Westgate Station, Northwind Tower, Maplewood Conservatory, Cobalt Market, Quartz District, Gilded Archway, Velvet Corner. \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, Westgate Station, Quarry Point, Cobalt Market, Gilded Archway, Velvet Corner. \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater, Quartz District, Gilded Archway, Velvet Corner. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier, Northwind Tower, Quarry Point, Maplewood Conservatory, Opal Theater, Quartz District, Gilded Archway, Velvet Corner. \nThe Lunar Pier has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, Quarry Point, Cobalt Market, Duskwood Park, Quartz District. \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with Quarry Point, Opal Theater, Cobalt Market, Duskwood Park, King’s Row, Mosaic Plaza. \nThe Quarry Point has overlapping signal areas with Maplewood Conservatory, Cobalt Market, Copper Clock Square, Gilded Archway, Rosewood Hall. \nThe Maplewood Conservatory has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater, Duskwood Park, King’s Row, Mosaic Plaza. \nThe Opal Theater has overlapping signal areas with Quartz District, Gilded Archway. \nThe Cobalt Market has overlapping signal areas with Quartz District, Gilded Archway, Rosewood Hall. \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Gilded Archway, Velvet Corner. \nThe Copper Clock Square has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza, Velvet Corner. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Rosewood Hall. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Velvet Corner, Rosewood Hall. \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway. \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Velvet Corner. \nThe Velvet Corner has overlapping signal areas with Rosewood Hall. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

The network will cover 21 major locations in the city: Mosaic Plaza, Northwind Tower, Flare Alley, Pennywhistle Arcade, Moonlit Promenade, Lighthouse Point, Dragon’s Gate, Westgate Station, Evergreen Circle, Duskwood Park, Rosewood Hall, Haven Docks, Jade Fountain, Brass Lantern Tavern, Velvet Corner, Ironbridge Crossing, Umbra Theater, Gilded Archway, Echo Station, Union Square Market and King’s Row. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Moonlit Promenade, Duskwood Park, Rosewood Hall, Velvet Corner, Echo Station, King’s Row. \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with Flare Alley, Moonlit Promenade, Lighthouse Point, Westgate Station, Evergreen Circle, Duskwood Park, Haven Docks, Echo Station, King’s Row. \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Moonlit Promenade, Lighthouse Point, Dragon’s Gate, Duskwood Park, Rosewood Hall, Gilded Archway, Echo Station, Union Square Market, King’s Row. \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Lighthouse Point, Dragon’s Gate, Westgate Station, Evergreen Circle, Haven Docks, Umbra Theater, Echo Station, Union Square Market. \nThe Moonlit Promenade has overlapping signal areas with Evergreen Circle, Rosewood Hall, Haven Docks, Jade Fountain, Velvet Corner, Ironbridge Crossing, Gilded Archway, King’s Row. \nThe Lighthouse Point has overlapping signal areas with Evergreen Circle, Rosewood Hall, Haven Docks, Brass Lantern Tavern, Umbra Theater, Gilded Archway, Union Square Market. \nThe Dragon’s Gate has overlapping signal areas with Evergreen Circle, Rosewood Hall, Haven Docks, Jade Fountain, Echo Station, Union Square Market. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park, Haven Docks, Jade Fountain, Velvet Corner, Umbra Theater, Union Square Market, King’s Row. \nThe Evergreen Circle has overlapping signal areas with Rosewood Hall, Haven Docks, Jade Fountain, Velvet Corner, Ironbridge Crossing, Echo Station. \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Rosewood Hall, Haven Docks, Jade Fountain, Brass Lantern Tavern, Velvet Corner, Umbra Theater. \nThe Rosewood Hall has overlapping signal areas with Velvet Corner, Ironbridge Crossing, Gilded Archway, King’s Row. \nThe Haven Docks has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater, Gilded Archway, Echo Station. \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with Velvet Corner, Union Square Market, King’s Row. \nThe Velvet Corner has overlapping signal areas with Ironbridge Crossing. \nThe Ironbridge Crossing has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway, Echo Station. \nThe Umbra Theater has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station, Union Square Market. \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Union Square Market. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 21 major locations in the city: Pennywhistle Arcade, Silvercrest Observatory, Moonlit Promenade, Twilight Harbor, Lunar Pier, Quarry Point, Flare Alley, Flint Forge Quarter, Knight’s Market, Amber Plaza, Riverstone Wharf, Cobalt Market, Shadowbridge Arcade, Mosaic Plaza, Copper Clock Square, Horizon Mall, Haven Docks, Brass Lantern Tavern, Sapphire Arena, Northwind Tower and Jasper Marina. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Moonlit Promenade, Lunar Pier, Flare Alley, Knight’s Market, Riverstone Wharf, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier, Quarry Point, Flint Forge Quarter, Amber Plaza, Riverstone Wharf, Cobalt Market, Sapphire Arena, Northwind Tower, Jasper Marina. \nThe Moonlit Promenade has overlapping signal areas with Flint Forge Quarter, Shadowbridge Arcade, Mosaic Plaza, Horizon Mall, Northwind Tower, Jasper Marina. \nThe Twilight Harbor has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier, Quarry Point, Amber Plaza, Cobalt Market, Brass Lantern Tavern, Sapphire Arena. \nThe Lunar Pier has overlapping signal areas with Quarry Point, Flare Alley, Flint Forge Quarter, Knight’s Market, Amber Plaza, Riverstone Wharf, Copper Clock Square, Haven Docks, Northwind Tower, Jasper Marina. \nThe Quarry Point has overlapping signal areas with Flare Alley, Flint Forge Quarter, Knight’s Market, Cobalt Market, Shadowbridge Arcade. \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Flint Forge Quarter, Riverstone Wharf, Cobalt Market, Shadowbridge Arcade, Copper Clock Square, Horizon Mall, Sapphire Arena, Northwind Tower. \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Knight’s Market, Riverstone Wharf, Cobalt Market, Mosaic Plaza, Northwind Tower, Jasper Marina. \nThe Knight’s Market has overlapping signal areas with Amber Plaza, Sapphire Arena, Northwind Tower. \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Cobalt Market, Shadowbridge Arcade, Mosaic Plaza, Northwind Tower, Jasper Marina. \nThe Riverstone Wharf has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza, Brass Lantern Tavern, Sapphire Arena, Northwind Tower. \nThe Cobalt Market has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade, Mosaic Plaza, Copper Clock Square, Haven Docks, Brass Lantern Tavern, Sapphire Arena, Northwind Tower, Jasper Marina. \nThe Shadowbridge Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Northwind Tower, Jasper Marina. \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena, Northwind Tower, Jasper Marina. \nThe Copper Clock Square has overlapping signal areas with Haven Docks, Northwind Tower. \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Haven Docks, Jasper Marina. \nThe Haven Docks has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Jasper Marina. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 21 major locations in the city: Moonlit Promenade, Beacon Tower, Lunar Pier, Sapphire Arena, Umbra Theater, Evergreen Circle, Skyline Gardens, Silvercrest Observatory, Primrose Boulevard, Mosaic Plaza, Cobalt Market, Quarry Point, Duskwood Park, King’s Row, Zenith Arena, Brass Lantern Tavern, Riverstone Wharf, Union Square Market, Maplewood Conservatory, Gilded Archway and Jasper Marina. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Moonlit Promenade has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier, Primrose Boulevard, Maplewood Conservatory, Gilded Archway. \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier, Evergreen Circle, Skyline Gardens, Cobalt Market, King’s Row, Riverstone Wharf, Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Lunar Pier has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory, Mosaic Plaza, Quarry Point, Duskwood Park, Union Square Market, Gilded Archway, Jasper Marina. \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater, Evergreen Circle, Skyline Gardens, Silvercrest Observatory, Cobalt Market, Quarry Point, Zenith Arena, Brass Lantern Tavern, Union Square Market, Gilded Archway. \nThe Umbra Theater has overlapping signal areas with Evergreen Circle, Skyline Gardens, Silvercrest Observatory, Mosaic Plaza, Cobalt Market, King’s Row, Union Square Market, Jasper Marina. \nThe Evergreen Circle has overlapping signal areas with Zenith Arena, Brass Lantern Tavern, Riverstone Wharf, Maplewood Conservatory, Gilded Archway, Jasper Marina. \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Primrose Boulevard, Mosaic Plaza, Cobalt Market, Zenith Arena, Union Square Market, Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza, Quarry Point, Duskwood Park, Zenith Arena, Brass Lantern Tavern, Maplewood Conservatory, Jasper Marina. \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza, Cobalt Market, Riverstone Wharf, Union Square Market, Jasper Marina. \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Cobalt Market, Duskwood Park, Brass Lantern Tavern, Union Square Market, Maplewood Conservatory, Gilded Archway, Jasper Marina. \nThe Cobalt Market has overlapping signal areas with Quarry Point, Duskwood Park, Zenith Arena, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Quarry Point has overlapping signal areas with Riverstone Wharf, Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Union Square Market, Gilded Archway. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Zenith Arena, Brass Lantern Tavern, Riverstone Wharf, Gilded Archway, Jasper Marina. \nThe Zenith Arena has overlapping signal areas with Maplewood Conservatory, Gilded Archway, Jasper Marina. \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Union Square Market has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway. \nThe Maplewood Conservatory has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway. \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 21 major locations in the city: Dragon’s Gate, Silvercrest Observatory, Union Square Market, Umbra Theater, Northwind Tower, Westgate Station, Primrose Boulevard, Opal Theater, King’s Row, Quartz District, Ironbridge Crossing, Oakshade Library, Amber Plaza, Flint Forge Quarter, Velvet Corner, Mosaic Plaza, Brass Lantern Tavern, Riverstone Wharf, Pennywhistle Arcade, Gilded Archway and Moonlit Promenade. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Dragon’s Gate has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater, Northwind Tower, King’s Row, Quartz District, Oakshade Library, Brass Lantern Tavern, Pennywhistle Arcade, Gilded Archway, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, Opal Theater, King’s Row, Ironbridge Crossing, Flint Forge Quarter, Mosaic Plaza, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Union Square Market has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater, Northwind Tower, Westgate Station, Primrose Boulevard, Opal Theater, King’s Row, Ironbridge Crossing, Amber Plaza, Velvet Corner, Mosaic Plaza, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Umbra Theater has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, King’s Row, Quartz District, Flint Forge Quarter, Velvet Corner, Mosaic Plaza, Riverstone Wharf, Pennywhistle Arcade, Gilded Archway, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with Primrose Boulevard, Ironbridge Crossing, Oakshade Library, Mosaic Plaza, Brass Lantern Tavern, Riverstone Wharf, Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Ironbridge Crossing, Oakshade Library, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater, Quartz District, Amber Plaza, Velvet Corner, Mosaic Plaza, Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Opal Theater has overlapping signal areas with Quartz District, Velvet Corner, Brass Lantern Tavern, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Ironbridge Crossing, Oakshade Library, Amber Plaza, Riverstone Wharf, Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Ironbridge Crossing has overlapping signal areas with Amber Plaza, Velvet Corner, Mosaic Plaza, Riverstone Wharf, Pennywhistle Arcade, Gilded Archway, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Oakshade Library has overlapping signal areas with Flint Forge Quarter, Velvet Corner, Mosaic Plaza, Brass Lantern Tavern, Riverstone Wharf, Gilded Archway, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza, Brass Lantern Tavern, Pennywhistle Arcade, Gilded Archway, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza. \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with Riverstone Wharf, Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway. \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Moonlit Promenade. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

The network will cover 21 major locations in the city: Granite Plaza, Umbra Theater, Willowshade Pavilion, Riverstone Wharf, Westgate Station, Maplewood Conservatory, Gilded Archway, Echo Station, Oakshade Library, Rosewood Hall, Azure Gardens, Skyline Gardens, Jade Fountain, Quartz District, Mosaic Plaza, King’s Row, Evergreen Circle, Flint Forge Quarter, Yarrow Plaza, Primrose Boulevard and Brass Lantern Tavern. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Riverstone Wharf, Maplewood Conservatory, Gilded Archway, Skyline Gardens, Quartz District, Flint Forge Quarter, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Umbra Theater has overlapping signal areas with Oakshade Library, Azure Gardens, Skyline Gardens, Jade Fountain, Flint Forge Quarter, Primrose Boulevard, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Willowshade Pavilion has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway, Echo Station, Rosewood Hall, Azure Gardens, Skyline Gardens, Jade Fountain, Mosaic Plaza, King’s Row, Yarrow Plaza, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Riverstone Wharf has overlapping signal areas with Maplewood Conservatory, Oakshade Library, Rosewood Hall, Skyline Gardens, Jade Fountain, Quartz District, King’s Row, Evergreen Circle. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Maplewood Conservatory, Gilded Archway, Rosewood Hall, Skyline Gardens, Evergreen Circle. \nThe Maplewood Conservatory has overlapping signal areas with Rosewood Hall, Azure Gardens, Skyline Gardens, Jade Fountain, Quartz District, King’s Row, Flint Forge Quarter, Yarrow Plaza, Primrose Boulevard, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Oakshade Library, Evergreen Circle, Primrose Boulevard, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with Oakshade Library, Rosewood Hall, Quartz District, King’s Row, Yarrow Plaza. \nThe Oakshade Library has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Rosewood Hall has overlapping signal areas with Azure Gardens, Jade Fountain, Quartz District, Flint Forge Quarter, Yarrow Plaza. \nThe Azure Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Jade Fountain, Quartz District, Mosaic Plaza, King’s Row, Evergreen Circle, Yarrow Plaza, Primrose Boulevard, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Jade Fountain. \nThe Jade Fountain has overlapping signal areas with Quartz District, Mosaic Plaza, Evergreen Circle. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Evergreen Circle, Flint Forge Quarter, Yarrow Plaza. \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Evergreen Circle, Yarrow Plaza, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Primrose Boulevard, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Primrose Boulevard, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 21 major locations in the city: Oakshade Library, Echo Station, Knight’s Market, King’s Row, Jasper Marina, Granite Plaza, Silvercrest Observatory, Zenith Arena, Gilded Archway, Willowshade Pavilion, Primrose Boulevard, Lunar Pier, Skyline Gardens, Umbra Theater, Mosaic Plaza, Brass Lantern Tavern, Quarry Point, Northwind Tower, Quartz District, Maplewood Conservatory and Shadowbridge Arcade. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Oakshade Library has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station, Knight’s Market, King’s Row, Silvercrest Observatory, Primrose Boulevard, Mosaic Plaza, Quarry Point, Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Jasper Marina, Granite Plaza, Willowshade Pavilion, Lunar Pier, Umbra Theater, Mosaic Plaza, Quartz District, Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Knight’s Market has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina, Silvercrest Observatory, Willowshade Pavilion, Primrose Boulevard, Lunar Pier. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina, Zenith Arena, Gilded Archway, Mosaic Plaza, Northwind Tower, Quartz District, Shadowbridge Arcade. \nThe Jasper Marina has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza, Gilded Archway, Umbra Theater, Mosaic Plaza. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory, Zenith Arena, Gilded Archway, Willowshade Pavilion, Primrose Boulevard, Lunar Pier, Skyline Gardens, Brass Lantern Tavern, Maplewood Conservatory, Shadowbridge Arcade. \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with Primrose Boulevard, Mosaic Plaza, Brass Lantern Tavern, Quartz District, Shadowbridge Arcade. \nThe Zenith Arena has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Umbra Theater, Mosaic Plaza, Brass Lantern Tavern, Northwind Tower, Quartz District, Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Quarry Point, Quartz District. \nThe Willowshade Pavilion has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier, Umbra Theater, Mosaic Plaza, Quarry Point, Maplewood Conservatory, Shadowbridge Arcade. \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens, Mosaic Plaza, Maplewood Conservatory, Shadowbridge Arcade. \nThe Lunar Pier has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater, Mosaic Plaza, Brass Lantern Tavern, Quarry Point, Northwind Tower, Shadowbridge Arcade. \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater, Brass Lantern Tavern, Quarry Point, Northwind Tower. \nThe Umbra Theater has overlapping signal areas with Quarry Point, Maplewood Conservatory, Shadowbridge Arcade. \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Quarry Point, Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Quarry Point has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade. \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with Quartz District, Maplewood Conservatory, Shadowbridge Arcade. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 21 major locations in the city: Ivory Spire Cathedral, Haven Docks, Azure Gardens, Sapphire Arena, Nimbus Plaza, Dragon’s Gate, Riverstone Wharf, Yarrow Plaza, Northwind Tower, Lighthouse Point, Twilight Harbor, Ironbridge Crossing, Lunar Pier, Maplewood Conservatory, Mosaic Plaza, Evergreen Circle, Umbra Theater, Willowshade Pavilion, Zenith Arena, Quarry Point and Beacon Tower. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Nimbus Plaza, Dragon’s Gate, Riverstone Wharf, Evergreen Circle, Willowshade Pavilion, Zenith Arena, Beacon Tower. \nThe Haven Docks has overlapping signal areas with Nimbus Plaza, Yarrow Plaza, Northwind Tower, Twilight Harbor, Lunar Pier, Maplewood Conservatory, Mosaic Plaza, Umbra Theater, Willowshade Pavilion. \nThe Azure Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena, Riverstone Wharf, Yarrow Plaza, Lunar Pier, Maplewood Conservatory, Mosaic Plaza, Evergreen Circle, Zenith Arena. \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, Lighthouse Point, Ironbridge Crossing, Maplewood Conservatory, Mosaic Plaza, Evergreen Circle, Umbra Theater, Quarry Point, Beacon Tower. \nThe Nimbus Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Dragon’s Gate, Twilight Harbor, Ironbridge Crossing, Evergreen Circle, Quarry Point, Beacon Tower. \nThe Dragon’s Gate has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, Northwind Tower, Lighthouse Point, Maplewood Conservatory, Mosaic Plaza, Umbra Theater, Willowshade Pavilion, Zenith Arena. \nThe Riverstone Wharf has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, Lighthouse Point, Mosaic Plaza, Umbra Theater, Zenith Arena, Beacon Tower. \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, Lighthouse Point, Evergreen Circle, Zenith Arena, Quarry Point, Beacon Tower. \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Quarry Point, Beacon Tower. \nThe Lighthouse Point has overlapping signal areas with Twilight Harbor, Ironbridge Crossing, Lunar Pier, Willowshade Pavilion, Zenith Arena, Quarry Point. \nThe Twilight Harbor has overlapping signal areas with Maplewood Conservatory, Umbra Theater, Zenith Arena, Quarry Point, Beacon Tower. \nThe Ironbridge Crossing has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier, Mosaic Plaza, Evergreen Circle. \nThe Lunar Pier has overlapping signal areas with Maplewood Conservatory, Mosaic Plaza, Willowshade Pavilion. \nThe Maplewood Conservatory has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater. \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater, Willowshade Pavilion. \nThe Evergreen Circle has overlapping signal areas with Quarry Point, Beacon Tower. \nThe Umbra Theater has overlapping signal areas with Quarry Point, Beacon Tower. \nThe Willowshade Pavilion has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower. \nThe Zenith Arena has overlapping signal areas with Quarry Point. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 21 major locations in the city: Duskwood Park, Knight’s Market, Rosewood Hall, Shadowbridge Arcade, Quartz District, Horizon Mall, Beacon Tower, Mosaic Plaza, Jasper Marina, Opal Theater, Azure Gardens, Haven Docks, Westgate Station, Moonlit Promenade, Evergreen Circle, Dragon’s Gate, Willowshade Pavilion, Sapphire Arena, Jade Fountain, Temple Square and Gilded Archway. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Knight’s Market, Rosewood Hall, Shadowbridge Arcade, Beacon Tower, Azure Gardens, Willowshade Pavilion, Sapphire Arena. \nThe Knight’s Market has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade, Horizon Mall, Mosaic Plaza, Haven Docks. \nThe Rosewood Hall has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade, Quartz District, Mosaic Plaza, Jasper Marina, Opal Theater, Azure Gardens, Westgate Station, Moonlit Promenade, Evergreen Circle, Dragon’s Gate, Willowshade Pavilion, Sapphire Arena, Jade Fountain, Temple Square. \nThe Shadowbridge Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater, Haven Docks, Moonlit Promenade, Evergreen Circle, Dragon’s Gate, Sapphire Arena. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Horizon Mall, Beacon Tower, Mosaic Plaza, Jasper Marina, Opal Theater, Azure Gardens, Haven Docks, Westgate Station, Dragon’s Gate, Sapphire Arena, Jade Fountain, Temple Square. \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Haven Docks, Sapphire Arena. \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina, Opal Theater, Azure Gardens, Westgate Station, Willowshade Pavilion, Sapphire Arena, Gilded Archway. \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina, Westgate Station, Moonlit Promenade, Evergreen Circle, Temple Square, Gilded Archway. \nThe Jasper Marina has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater, Azure Gardens, Haven Docks, Willowshade Pavilion. \nThe Opal Theater has overlapping signal areas with Haven Docks, Temple Square. \nThe Azure Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Haven Docks, Evergreen Circle, Dragon’s Gate, Sapphire Arena. \nThe Haven Docks has overlapping signal areas with Westgate Station, Moonlit Promenade, Evergreen Circle, Willowshade Pavilion, Sapphire Arena, Jade Fountain. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Moonlit Promenade, Jade Fountain, Temple Square. \nThe Moonlit Promenade has overlapping signal areas with Evergreen Circle, Willowshade Pavilion, Jade Fountain, Gilded Archway. \nThe Evergreen Circle has overlapping signal areas with Temple Square. \nThe Dragon’s Gate has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena, Temple Square. \nThe Willowshade Pavilion has overlapping signal areas with Temple Square. \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with Temple Square, Gilded Archway. \nThe Jade Fountain has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

The network will cover 21 major locations in the city: Lunar Pier, Pennywhistle Arcade, Duskwood Park, Cobalt Market, Jasper Marina, Westgate Station, Northwind Tower, Shadowbridge Arcade, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Rosewood Hall, Brass Lantern Tavern, Willowshade Pavilion, Amber Plaza, Ironbridge Crossing, Quarry Point, Flint Forge Quarter, Gilded Archway, Maplewood Conservatory, Riverstone Wharf, Beacon Tower and King’s Row. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Lunar Pier has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade, Cobalt Market, Jasper Marina, Rosewood Hall, Brass Lantern Tavern, Amber Plaza, Ironbridge Crossing, Quarry Point, Gilded Archway, King’s Row. \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral, Ironbridge Crossing, Quarry Point, Gilded Archway, Maplewood Conservatory, Riverstone Wharf, King’s Row. \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina, Westgate Station, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Willowshade Pavilion, Ironbridge Crossing, Quarry Point, Gilded Archway, Riverstone Wharf, King’s Row. \nThe Cobalt Market has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Willowshade Pavilion, Ironbridge Crossing, Quarry Point, Gilded Archway, Beacon Tower. \nThe Jasper Marina has overlapping signal areas with Westgate Station, Shadowbridge Arcade, Brass Lantern Tavern, Ironbridge Crossing, Flint Forge Quarter, Riverstone Wharf, Beacon Tower, King’s Row. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, Rosewood Hall, Amber Plaza, Ironbridge Crossing, Quarry Point, Gilded Archway, Maplewood Conservatory, King’s Row. \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Willowshade Pavilion, Ironbridge Crossing, Flint Forge Quarter, Maplewood Conservatory, Riverstone Wharf, Beacon Tower, King’s Row. \nThe Shadowbridge Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral, Quarry Point, Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Quarry Point, Gilded Archway, Beacon Tower. \nThe Rosewood Hall has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Quarry Point, Flint Forge Quarter, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Willowshade Pavilion has overlapping signal areas with Quarry Point, Gilded Archway, Riverstone Wharf, Beacon Tower. \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Flint Forge Quarter, Gilded Archway, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Ironbridge Crossing has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower, King’s Row. \nThe Quarry Point has overlapping signal areas with Flint Forge Quarter, Beacon Tower. \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway, Maplewood Conservatory, Beacon Tower. \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Maplewood Conservatory, King’s Row. \nThe Maplewood Conservatory has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower. \nThe Riverstone Wharf has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower, King’s Row. \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference.

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 21 major locations in the city: Temple Square, Umbra Theater, Ironbridge Crossing, Lunar Pier, Silvercrest Observatory, Granite Plaza, Willowshade Pavilion, Flint Forge Quarter, Primrose Boulevard, Brass Lantern Tavern, King’s Row, Evergreen Circle, Opal Theater, Sapphire Arena, Velvet Corner, Jade Fountain, Lighthouse Point, Flare Alley, Beacon Tower, Riverstone Wharf and Twilight Harbor. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Temple Square has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater, Ironbridge Crossing, Lunar Pier, King’s Row, Evergreen Circle, Opal Theater, Sapphire Arena, Velvet Corner, Lighthouse Point. \nThe Umbra Theater has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory, Granite Plaza, Willowshade Pavilion, Flint Forge Quarter, Primrose Boulevard, Opal Theater, Jade Fountain, Flare Alley, Beacon Tower, Twilight Harbor. \nThe Ironbridge Crossing has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory, Opal Theater, Velvet Corner, Lighthouse Point, Beacon Tower, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Lunar Pier has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Evergreen Circle, Jade Fountain, Lighthouse Point. \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Flint Forge Quarter, Primrose Boulevard, Brass Lantern Tavern, King’s Row, Evergreen Circle, Riverstone Wharf, Twilight Harbor. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Primrose Boulevard, King’s Row, Evergreen Circle, Velvet Corner, Flare Alley, Beacon Tower, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Willowshade Pavilion has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Opal Theater, Jade Fountain, Riverstone Wharf, Twilight Harbor. \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Primrose Boulevard, Brass Lantern Tavern, King’s Row, Evergreen Circle, Jade Fountain, Beacon Tower, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Opal Theater, Velvet Corner, Jade Fountain, Lighthouse Point, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with Evergreen Circle, Opal Theater, Flare Alley. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Evergreen Circle, Sapphire Arena, Jade Fountain, Beacon Tower, Twilight Harbor. \nThe Evergreen Circle has overlapping signal areas with Lighthouse Point, Beacon Tower, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Opal Theater has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena, Jade Fountain, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with Jade Fountain, Lighthouse Point, Beacon Tower. \nThe Velvet Corner has overlapping signal areas with Flare Alley, Twilight Harbor. \nThe Lighthouse Point has overlapping signal areas with Twilight Harbor. \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with Riverstone Wharf, Twilight Harbor. \nThe Riverstone Wharf has overlapping signal areas with Twilight Harbor. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 21 major locations in the city: Union Square Market, Lighthouse Point, Skyline Gardens, Twilight Harbor, Beacon Tower, Cobalt Market, King’s Row, Horizon Mall, Mosaic Plaza, Oakshade Library, Westgate Station, Umbra Theater, Haven Docks, Quarry Point, Gilded Archway, Evergreen Circle, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Flare Alley, Silvercrest Observatory, Sapphire Arena and Zenith Arena. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Union Square Market has overlapping signal areas with Lighthouse Point, Twilight Harbor, Cobalt Market, Mosaic Plaza, Umbra Theater, Haven Docks, Flare Alley, Zenith Arena. \nThe Lighthouse Point has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens, Twilight Harbor, King’s Row, Mosaic Plaza, Westgate Station, Haven Docks, Quarry Point, Evergreen Circle, Silvercrest Observatory. \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Oakshade Library, Evergreen Circle, Flare Alley. \nThe Twilight Harbor has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower, King’s Row, Horizon Mall, Oakshade Library, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Sapphire Arena, Zenith Arena. \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Horizon Mall, Westgate Station, Quarry Point, Flare Alley, Sapphire Arena, Zenith Arena. \nThe Cobalt Market has overlapping signal areas with Westgate Station, Umbra Theater, Haven Docks, Quarry Point, Flare Alley, Sapphire Arena, Zenith Arena. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Horizon Mall, Mosaic Plaza, Oakshade Library, Westgate Station, Umbra Theater, Haven Docks, Gilded Archway, Evergreen Circle, Silvercrest Observatory, Sapphire Arena. \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza, Westgate Station, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Flare Alley, Silvercrest Observatory, Sapphire Arena, Zenith Arena. \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Quarry Point, Flare Alley, Zenith Arena. \nThe Oakshade Library has overlapping signal areas with Westgate Station, Umbra Theater, Haven Docks, Quarry Point, Gilded Archway, Silvercrest Observatory. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway, Evergreen Circle, Silvercrest Observatory. \nThe Umbra Theater has overlapping signal areas with Quarry Point, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Silvercrest Observatory. \nThe Haven Docks has overlapping signal areas with Quarry Point, Gilded Archway, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Silvercrest Observatory. \nThe Quarry Point has overlapping signal areas with Zenith Arena. \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Evergreen Circle has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral, Sapphire Arena, Zenith Arena. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Flare Alley, Zenith Arena. \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Zenith Arena. \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with Zenith Arena. \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with Zenith Arena. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",
