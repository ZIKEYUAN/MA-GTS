  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 10 major locations in the city: Nimbus Plaza, Westgate Station, Umbra Theater, Flare Alley, Riverstone Wharf, Temple Square, Willowshade Pavilion, Lighthouse Point, Moonlit Promenade and Jasper Marina. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Nimbus Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Westgate Station, Umbra Theater, Flare Alley, Riverstone Wharf, Willowshade Pavilion, Lighthouse Point. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Flare Alley, Riverstone Wharf, Lighthouse Point. \nThe Umbra Theater has overlapping signal areas with Lighthouse Point. \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Temple Square, Willowshade Pavilion, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Riverstone Wharf has overlapping signal areas with Temple Square, Willowshade Pavilion, Lighthouse Point, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Temple Square has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion. \nThe Willowshade Pavilion has overlapping signal areas with Moonlit Promenade, Jasper Marina. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",
