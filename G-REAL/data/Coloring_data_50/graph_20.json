  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 20 major locations in the city: Yarrow Plaza, Twilight Harbor, Westgate Station, Knight’s Market, Echo Station, Rosewood Hall, Lighthouse Point, Quarry Point, Union Square Market, Dragon’s Gate, Northwind Tower, Gilded Archway, Lunar Pier, Shadowbridge Arcade, Riverstone Wharf, Sapphire Arena, Silvercrest Observatory, Quartz District, Zenith Arena and Haven Docks. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Westgate Station, Rosewood Hall, Gilded Archway, Lunar Pier, Sapphire Arena, Quartz District. \nThe Twilight Harbor has overlapping signal areas with Westgate Station, Knight’s Market, Quarry Point, Union Square Market, Northwind Tower, Sapphire Arena, Silvercrest Observatory, Quartz District, Zenith Arena. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Knight’s Market, Echo Station, Lighthouse Point, Gilded Archway, Riverstone Wharf, Quartz District. \nThe Knight’s Market has overlapping signal areas with Quarry Point, Dragon’s Gate, Sapphire Arena, Silvercrest Observatory, Quartz District, Zenith Arena, Haven Docks. \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with Dragon’s Gate, Gilded Archway, Riverstone Wharf, Silvercrest Observatory. \nThe Rosewood Hall has overlapping signal areas with Lighthouse Point, Northwind Tower, Gilded Archway, Lunar Pier, Sapphire Arena, Quartz District, Zenith Arena, Haven Docks. \nThe Lighthouse Point has overlapping signal areas with Union Square Market, Shadowbridge Arcade, Riverstone Wharf, Silvercrest Observatory. \nThe Quarry Point has overlapping signal areas with Dragon’s Gate, Northwind Tower, Gilded Archway, Riverstone Wharf, Sapphire Arena, Quartz District, Zenith Arena. \nThe Union Square Market has overlapping signal areas with Dragon’s Gate, Riverstone Wharf, Sapphire Arena, Silvercrest Observatory. \nThe Dragon’s Gate has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier, Silvercrest Observatory, Quartz District. \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway, Lunar Pier, Shadowbridge Arcade, Riverstone Wharf, Zenith Arena. \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier, Silvercrest Observatory, Quartz District, Haven Docks. \nThe Lunar Pier has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena, Silvercrest Observatory, Zenith Arena, Haven Docks. \nThe Shadowbridge Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena. \nThe Riverstone Wharf has overlapping signal areas with Quartz District, Zenith Arena, Haven Docks. \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory, Quartz District, Zenith Arena. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Zenith Arena, Haven Docks. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 20 major locations in the city: Mosaic Plaza, Northwind Tower, Jade Fountain, Lighthouse Point, Lunar Pier, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Skyline Gardens, Granite Plaza, Twilight Harbor, Yarrow Plaza, Brass Lantern Tavern, Westgate Station, King’s Row, Moonlit Promenade, Knight’s Market, Quartz District, Nimbus Plaza, Ironbridge Crossing, Velvet Corner and Jasper Marina. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Jade Fountain, Lunar Pier, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Yarrow Plaza, Quartz District, Nimbus Plaza, Jasper Marina. \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, Brass Lantern Tavern, Knight’s Market, Nimbus Plaza, Velvet Corner. \nThe Jade Fountain has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier, Skyline Gardens, Twilight Harbor, Yarrow Plaza, Brass Lantern Tavern, Quartz District, Velvet Corner. \nThe Lighthouse Point has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier, Skyline Gardens, Twilight Harbor, King’s Row, Knight’s Market, Quartz District, Ironbridge Crossing. \nThe Lunar Pier has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral, Skyline Gardens, Yarrow Plaza, Brass Lantern Tavern, King’s Row, Ironbridge Crossing, Jasper Marina. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens, Twilight Harbor, Yarrow Plaza, Westgate Station, King’s Row, Moonlit Promenade, Knight’s Market, Nimbus Plaza, Velvet Corner. \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza, Twilight Harbor, Westgate Station, Knight’s Market, Nimbus Plaza. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Moonlit Promenade, Quartz District, Nimbus Plaza, Jasper Marina. \nThe Twilight Harbor has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, Brass Lantern Tavern, Quartz District, Ironbridge Crossing. \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Westgate Station, Knight’s Market, Quartz District, Nimbus Plaza, Ironbridge Crossing, Velvet Corner, Jasper Marina. \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with Westgate Station, Nimbus Plaza. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Moonlit Promenade, Knight’s Market, Quartz District. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Moonlit Promenade, Quartz District, Jasper Marina. \nThe Moonlit Promenade has overlapping signal areas with Knight’s Market, Quartz District. \nThe Knight’s Market has overlapping signal areas with Quartz District, Nimbus Plaza, Ironbridge Crossing. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Ironbridge Crossing. \nThe Nimbus Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Velvet Corner, Jasper Marina. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 20 major locations in the city: Primrose Boulevard, Haven Docks, Nimbus Plaza, Flare Alley, Jade Fountain, Echo Station, Mosaic Plaza, Yarrow Plaza, Beacon Tower, Azure Gardens, Brass Lantern Tavern, Oakshade Library, Horizon Mall, Shadowbridge Arcade, Temple Square, Lighthouse Point, Willowshade Pavilion, Granite Plaza, Quarry Point and Pennywhistle Arcade. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with Nimbus Plaza, Flare Alley, Jade Fountain, Oakshade Library, Horizon Mall, Lighthouse Point, Willowshade Pavilion, Granite Plaza, Quarry Point. \nThe Haven Docks has overlapping signal areas with Nimbus Plaza, Mosaic Plaza, Brass Lantern Tavern, Oakshade Library, Willowshade Pavilion, Granite Plaza, Quarry Point, Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Nimbus Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Jade Fountain, Mosaic Plaza, Brass Lantern Tavern, Oakshade Library, Shadowbridge Arcade, Temple Square, Willowshade Pavilion, Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, Azure Gardens, Lighthouse Point, Willowshade Pavilion. \nThe Jade Fountain has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station, Beacon Tower, Horizon Mall, Shadowbridge Arcade, Willowshade Pavilion. \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, Beacon Tower, Azure Gardens, Horizon Mall, Temple Square, Lighthouse Point. \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, Azure Gardens, Horizon Mall, Shadowbridge Arcade, Temple Square, Lighthouse Point, Granite Plaza, Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower, Horizon Mall, Temple Square, Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade, Temple Square, Willowshade Pavilion, Granite Plaza, Quarry Point. \nThe Azure Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Oakshade Library, Temple Square, Lighthouse Point, Granite Plaza, Quarry Point, Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade, Temple Square, Lighthouse Point, Willowshade Pavilion, Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Oakshade Library has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade, Willowshade Pavilion, Granite Plaza, Quarry Point. \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Lighthouse Point, Quarry Point, Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Shadowbridge Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Quarry Point, Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Temple Square has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 20 major locations in the city: Flare Alley, Lunar Pier, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Moonlit Promenade, Yarrow Plaza, Velvet Corner, Amber Plaza, Zenith Arena, Copper Clock Square, Sapphire Arena, Brass Lantern Tavern, Union Square Market, Cobalt Market, Echo Station, Ironbridge Crossing, Horizon Mall, Lighthouse Point, Temple Square, Azure Gardens and Knight’s Market. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral, Yarrow Plaza, Amber Plaza, Zenith Arena, Sapphire Arena, Echo Station, Ironbridge Crossing, Horizon Mall, Lighthouse Point, Azure Gardens. \nThe Lunar Pier has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral, Yarrow Plaza, Amber Plaza, Union Square Market, Cobalt Market, Echo Station, Horizon Mall, Lighthouse Point, Temple Square, Knight’s Market. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Moonlit Promenade, Yarrow Plaza, Velvet Corner, Sapphire Arena, Brass Lantern Tavern, Union Square Market, Echo Station, Knight’s Market. \nThe Moonlit Promenade has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, Velvet Corner, Zenith Arena, Copper Clock Square, Union Square Market, Ironbridge Crossing. \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Velvet Corner, Copper Clock Square, Sapphire Arena, Brass Lantern Tavern, Union Square Market, Cobalt Market, Ironbridge Crossing, Temple Square, Azure Gardens. \nThe Velvet Corner has overlapping signal areas with Zenith Arena, Copper Clock Square, Sapphire Arena, Brass Lantern Tavern, Horizon Mall, Knight’s Market. \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena, Union Square Market, Cobalt Market, Echo Station, Horizon Mall, Lighthouse Point, Temple Square, Azure Gardens. \nThe Zenith Arena has overlapping signal areas with Copper Clock Square, Sapphire Arena, Brass Lantern Tavern, Union Square Market. \nThe Copper Clock Square has overlapping signal areas with Cobalt Market, Lighthouse Point, Azure Gardens. \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with Union Square Market, Cobalt Market, Echo Station. \nThe Union Square Market has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station, Ironbridge Crossing, Temple Square, Knight’s Market. \nThe Cobalt Market has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station, Horizon Mall, Temple Square. \nThe Ironbridge Crossing has overlapping signal areas with Horizon Mall, Lighthouse Point, Azure Gardens. \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Temple Square. \nThe Lighthouse Point has overlapping signal areas with Azure Gardens. \nThe Azure Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Knight’s Market. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 20 major locations in the city: Rosewood Hall, Riverstone Wharf, Mosaic Plaza, Skyline Gardens, Lighthouse Point, King’s Row, Flare Alley, Oakshade Library, Temple Square, Lunar Pier, Gilded Archway, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Quartz District, Amber Plaza, Yarrow Plaza, Zenith Arena, Primrose Boulevard, Northwind Tower, Granite Plaza and Dragon’s Gate. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Rosewood Hall has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza, Lighthouse Point, Oakshade Library, Temple Square, Quartz District, Amber Plaza, Zenith Arena, Northwind Tower, Dragon’s Gate. \nThe Riverstone Wharf has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza, Skyline Gardens, Flare Alley, Temple Square, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Yarrow Plaza. \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Temple Square, Gilded Archway, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Lighthouse Point, Lunar Pier, Gilded Archway, Quartz District, Amber Plaza, Granite Plaza, Dragon’s Gate. \nThe Lighthouse Point has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Lunar Pier, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Amber Plaza, Zenith Arena, Northwind Tower, Dragon’s Gate. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, Zenith Arena, Northwind Tower, Granite Plaza, Dragon’s Gate. \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier, Gilded Archway, Quartz District, Northwind Tower, Granite Plaza. \nThe Oakshade Library has overlapping signal areas with Temple Square, Yarrow Plaza, Zenith Arena, Northwind Tower, Dragon’s Gate. \nThe Temple Square has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Zenith Arena, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Lunar Pier has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Amber Plaza, Yarrow Plaza, Zenith Arena, Granite Plaza. \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral, Amber Plaza, Zenith Arena, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Amber Plaza, Granite Plaza. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Zenith Arena, Primrose Boulevard, Granite Plaza, Dragon’s Gate. \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Primrose Boulevard, Granite Plaza, Dragon’s Gate. \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Zenith Arena, Primrose Boulevard, Granite Plaza, Dragon’s Gate. \nThe Zenith Arena has overlapping signal areas with Primrose Boulevard, Granite Plaza, Dragon’s Gate. \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, Dragon’s Gate. \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

The network will cover 20 major locations in the city: Ivory Spire Cathedral, Duskwood Park, Riverstone Wharf, Jade Fountain, Nimbus Plaza, Dragon’s Gate, Gilded Archway, Azure Gardens, Temple Square, Jasper Marina, Silvercrest Observatory, Horizon Mall, Moonlit Promenade, Granite Plaza, Evergreen Circle, Beacon Tower, Twilight Harbor, Flint Forge Quarter, Quarry Point and Zenith Arena. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Riverstone Wharf, Dragon’s Gate, Gilded Archway, Jasper Marina, Moonlit Promenade, Beacon Tower, Twilight Harbor, Flint Forge Quarter. \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Nimbus Plaza, Gilded Archway, Temple Square, Silvercrest Observatory, Granite Plaza, Evergreen Circle, Flint Forge Quarter, Quarry Point. \nThe Riverstone Wharf has overlapping signal areas with Nimbus Plaza, Temple Square, Jasper Marina, Moonlit Promenade, Granite Plaza, Beacon Tower, Twilight Harbor, Zenith Arena. \nThe Jade Fountain has overlapping signal areas with Dragon’s Gate, Silvercrest Observatory, Horizon Mall, Moonlit Promenade, Granite Plaza, Evergreen Circle, Beacon Tower, Twilight Harbor, Flint Forge Quarter, Zenith Arena. \nThe Nimbus Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Evergreen Circle, Beacon Tower, Twilight Harbor, Flint Forge Quarter. \nThe Dragon’s Gate has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway, Moonlit Promenade, Granite Plaza, Evergreen Circle, Beacon Tower, Flint Forge Quarter, Quarry Point. \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Azure Gardens, Jasper Marina, Moonlit Promenade, Flint Forge Quarter, Quarry Point. \nThe Azure Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina, Granite Plaza, Twilight Harbor. \nThe Temple Square has overlapping signal areas with Evergreen Circle, Twilight Harbor, Quarry Point. \nThe Jasper Marina has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory, Evergreen Circle, Beacon Tower, Zenith Arena. \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with Twilight Harbor, Flint Forge Quarter. \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza, Beacon Tower. \nThe Moonlit Promenade has overlapping signal areas with Evergreen Circle, Flint Forge Quarter, Zenith Arena. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Evergreen Circle, Beacon Tower, Flint Forge Quarter, Quarry Point, Zenith Arena. \nThe Evergreen Circle has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower, Twilight Harbor, Flint Forge Quarter, Zenith Arena. \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with Flint Forge Quarter, Zenith Arena. \nThe Twilight Harbor has overlapping signal areas with Quarry Point. \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Quarry Point. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 20 major locations in the city: Mosaic Plaza, Westgate Station, Sapphire Arena, Dragon’s Gate, Flint Forge Quarter, Rosewood Hall, Maplewood Conservatory, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Horizon Mall, Oakshade Library, Haven Docks, Northwind Tower, Twilight Harbor, Jasper Marina, Amber Plaza, Silvercrest Observatory, Quartz District, Skyline Gardens, Riverstone Wharf and Temple Square. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena, Rosewood Hall, Horizon Mall, Northwind Tower, Amber Plaza, Silvercrest Observatory, Skyline Gardens, Temple Square. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena, Flint Forge Quarter, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Oakshade Library, Northwind Tower, Twilight Harbor, Silvercrest Observatory, Quartz District, Skyline Gardens, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral, Oakshade Library, Haven Docks, Northwind Tower, Twilight Harbor, Jasper Marina, Amber Plaza, Quartz District, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Dragon’s Gate has overlapping signal areas with Maplewood Conservatory, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Horizon Mall, Twilight Harbor, Jasper Marina, Amber Plaza, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Rosewood Hall, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Oakshade Library, Twilight Harbor. \nThe Rosewood Hall has overlapping signal areas with Maplewood Conservatory, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Horizon Mall, Haven Docks, Northwind Tower, Jasper Marina, Amber Plaza, Quartz District, Skyline Gardens, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Maplewood Conservatory has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral, Horizon Mall, Amber Plaza. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Haven Docks, Northwind Tower, Silvercrest Observatory, Temple Square. \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Oakshade Library, Twilight Harbor, Jasper Marina, Silvercrest Observatory, Skyline Gardens, Temple Square. \nThe Oakshade Library has overlapping signal areas with Amber Plaza, Silvercrest Observatory. \nThe Haven Docks has overlapping signal areas with Twilight Harbor, Jasper Marina, Amber Plaza, Quartz District. \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina, Amber Plaza, Skyline Gardens, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Twilight Harbor has overlapping signal areas with Amber Plaza, Silvercrest Observatory, Quartz District, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Jasper Marina has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory, Skyline Gardens. \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Quartz District. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens. \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Temple Square. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 20 major locations in the city: Cobalt Market, Northwind Tower, Riverstone Wharf, Maplewood Conservatory, Dragon’s Gate, Lighthouse Point, Knight’s Market, Flint Forge Quarter, Moonlit Promenade, Haven Docks, Pennywhistle Arcade, Echo Station, Temple Square, Westgate Station, Lunar Pier, Yarrow Plaza, Quarry Point, Brass Lantern Tavern, Ironbridge Crossing and Mosaic Plaza. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Cobalt Market has overlapping signal areas with Maplewood Conservatory, Dragon’s Gate, Moonlit Promenade, Temple Square, Westgate Station, Brass Lantern Tavern, Mosaic Plaza. \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with Maplewood Conservatory, Moonlit Promenade, Echo Station, Temple Square, Westgate Station, Lunar Pier, Ironbridge Crossing, Mosaic Plaza. \nThe Riverstone Wharf has overlapping signal areas with Flint Forge Quarter, Haven Docks, Temple Square, Westgate Station, Mosaic Plaza. \nThe Maplewood Conservatory has overlapping signal areas with Lighthouse Point, Knight’s Market, Flint Forge Quarter, Moonlit Promenade, Haven Docks, Westgate Station, Lunar Pier, Brass Lantern Tavern, Mosaic Plaza. \nThe Dragon’s Gate has overlapping signal areas with Knight’s Market, Moonlit Promenade, Pennywhistle Arcade, Westgate Station, Yarrow Plaza, Ironbridge Crossing. \nThe Lighthouse Point has overlapping signal areas with Knight’s Market, Echo Station, Lunar Pier, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Knight’s Market has overlapping signal areas with Flint Forge Quarter, Moonlit Promenade, Pennywhistle Arcade, Westgate Station, Yarrow Plaza. \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station, Temple Square. \nThe Moonlit Promenade has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade, Echo Station, Westgate Station, Lunar Pier, Yarrow Plaza, Quarry Point, Brass Lantern Tavern, Ironbridge Crossing, Mosaic Plaza. \nThe Haven Docks has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade, Echo Station, Temple Square, Ironbridge Crossing, Mosaic Plaza. \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station, Lunar Pier, Yarrow Plaza, Quarry Point, Ironbridge Crossing. \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with Temple Square, Quarry Point, Mosaic Plaza. \nThe Temple Square has overlapping signal areas with Westgate Station, Quarry Point, Mosaic Plaza. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza. \nThe Lunar Pier has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza. \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Quarry Point, Brass Lantern Tavern, Ironbridge Crossing, Mosaic Plaza. \nThe Quarry Point has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with Ironbridge Crossing, Mosaic Plaza. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 20 major locations in the city: Silvercrest Observatory, Flare Alley, Sapphire Arena, Dragon’s Gate, Riverstone Wharf, Ironbridge Crossing, Flint Forge Quarter, Quartz District, Cobalt Market, Nimbus Plaza, Azure Gardens, Lunar Pier, Amber Plaza, Willowshade Pavilion, Twilight Harbor, Brass Lantern Tavern, Granite Plaza, Mosaic Plaza, Pennywhistle Arcade and Rosewood Hall. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with Riverstone Wharf, Flint Forge Quarter, Quartz District, Nimbus Plaza, Azure Gardens, Amber Plaza, Willowshade Pavilion, Twilight Harbor, Mosaic Plaza, Rosewood Hall. \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena, Dragon’s Gate, Cobalt Market, Amber Plaza, Twilight Harbor, Granite Plaza, Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with Ironbridge Crossing, Twilight Harbor, Brass Lantern Tavern, Granite Plaza, Mosaic Plaza, Rosewood Hall. \nThe Dragon’s Gate has overlapping signal areas with Riverstone Wharf, Flint Forge Quarter, Quartz District, Nimbus Plaza, Azure Gardens, Amber Plaza. \nThe Riverstone Wharf has overlapping signal areas with Ironbridge Crossing, Quartz District, Nimbus Plaza, Azure Gardens, Twilight Harbor. \nThe Ironbridge Crossing has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier, Willowshade Pavilion, Twilight Harbor, Brass Lantern Tavern, Mosaic Plaza, Rosewood Hall. \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Nimbus Plaza, Azure Gardens, Lunar Pier, Twilight Harbor, Mosaic Plaza, Rosewood Hall. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Cobalt Market, Lunar Pier, Granite Plaza, Pennywhistle Arcade, Rosewood Hall. \nThe Cobalt Market has overlapping signal areas with Nimbus Plaza, Willowshade Pavilion, Twilight Harbor, Granite Plaza. \nThe Nimbus Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Amber Plaza. \nThe Azure Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier, Amber Plaza, Twilight Harbor, Brass Lantern Tavern, Pennywhistle Arcade, Rosewood Hall. \nThe Lunar Pier has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Granite Plaza, Rosewood Hall. \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Twilight Harbor, Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Willowshade Pavilion has overlapping signal areas with Twilight Harbor, Brass Lantern Tavern, Granite Plaza, Pennywhistle Arcade, Rosewood Hall. \nThe Twilight Harbor has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza, Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza, Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade, Rosewood Hall. \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade, Rosewood Hall. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 20 major locations in the city: Moonlit Promenade, Riverstone Wharf, Yarrow Plaza, Knight’s Market, Sapphire Arena, Pennywhistle Arcade, Granite Plaza, Quartz District, Flare Alley, Copper Clock Square, Primrose Boulevard, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Beacon Tower, Cobalt Market, Evergreen Circle, Lighthouse Point, Echo Station, Maplewood Conservatory, Ironbridge Crossing and Shadowbridge Arcade. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Moonlit Promenade has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, Knight’s Market, Sapphire Arena, Pennywhistle Arcade, Granite Plaza, Quartz District, Flare Alley, Copper Clock Square, Lighthouse Point, Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Riverstone Wharf has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, Sapphire Arena, Pennywhistle Arcade, Primrose Boulevard, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Quartz District, Flare Alley, Beacon Tower, Cobalt Market, Evergreen Circle, Lighthouse Point, Echo Station, Shadowbridge Arcade. \nThe Knight’s Market has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade, Flare Alley, Primrose Boulevard, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Shadowbridge Arcade. \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza, Copper Clock Square, Primrose Boulevard, Evergreen Circle, Echo Station, Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Quartz District, Flare Alley, Beacon Tower, Shadowbridge Arcade. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral, Beacon Tower, Evergreen Circle, Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Flare Alley, Primrose Boulevard, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Evergreen Circle, Lighthouse Point, Maplewood Conservatory, Ironbridge Crossing. \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Copper Clock Square, Primrose Boulevard, Beacon Tower, Evergreen Circle, Lighthouse Point, Echo Station, Maplewood Conservatory, Ironbridge Crossing. \nThe Copper Clock Square has overlapping signal areas with Evergreen Circle, Maplewood Conservatory, Ironbridge Crossing, Shadowbridge Arcade. \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with Cobalt Market, Ironbridge Crossing, Shadowbridge Arcade. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Evergreen Circle, Lighthouse Point, Echo Station, Maplewood Conservatory, Ironbridge Crossing. \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with Cobalt Market. \nThe Cobalt Market has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station, Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Evergreen Circle has overlapping signal areas with Lighthouse Point, Echo Station, Shadowbridge Arcade. \nThe Lighthouse Point has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station, Maplewood Conservatory, Shadowbridge Arcade. \nThe Maplewood Conservatory has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade. \nThe Ironbridge Crossing has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 20 major locations in the city: Azure Gardens, Sapphire Arena, Shadowbridge Arcade, Oakshade Library, Umbra Theater, King’s Row, Quarry Point, Copper Clock Square, Jasper Marina, Union Square Market, Beacon Tower, Rosewood Hall, Riverstone Wharf, Gilded Archway, Westgate Station, Echo Station, Dragon’s Gate, Haven Docks, Mosaic Plaza and Brass Lantern Tavern. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Azure Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater, King’s Row, Quarry Point, Copper Clock Square, Jasper Marina, Union Square Market, Gilded Archway, Echo Station, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with Quarry Point, Copper Clock Square, Rosewood Hall, Riverstone Wharf, Westgate Station, Dragon’s Gate, Mosaic Plaza. \nThe Shadowbridge Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater, Jasper Marina, Union Square Market, Beacon Tower, Rosewood Hall, Echo Station, Dragon’s Gate, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Oakshade Library has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower, Westgate Station, Dragon’s Gate, Mosaic Plaza. \nThe Umbra Theater has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Quarry Point, Copper Clock Square, Union Square Market, Beacon Tower, Echo Station, Haven Docks, Mosaic Plaza. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Union Square Market, Gilded Archway, Echo Station. \nThe Quarry Point has overlapping signal areas with Copper Clock Square, Beacon Tower, Riverstone Wharf, Gilded Archway, Haven Docks, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Copper Clock Square has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina, Beacon Tower, Gilded Archway, Westgate Station, Echo Station, Dragon’s Gate, Mosaic Plaza, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Jasper Marina has overlapping signal areas with Union Square Market, Beacon Tower, Rosewood Hall, Riverstone Wharf, Gilded Archway, Westgate Station, Dragon’s Gate. \nThe Union Square Market has overlapping signal areas with Riverstone Wharf, Dragon’s Gate, Haven Docks. \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with Riverstone Wharf, Gilded Archway, Dragon’s Gate, Mosaic Plaza. \nThe Rosewood Hall has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway, Haven Docks, Mosaic Plaza. \nThe Riverstone Wharf has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Westgate Station, Dragon’s Gate, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with Dragon’s Gate, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Haven Docks has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 20 major locations in the city: Westgate Station, Skyline Gardens, Riverstone Wharf, Silvercrest Observatory, King’s Row, Beacon Tower, Primrose Boulevard, Velvet Corner, Umbra Theater, Cobalt Market, Twilight Harbor, Duskwood Park, Zenith Arena, Shadowbridge Arcade, Quarry Point, Horizon Mall, Granite Plaza, Dragon’s Gate, Ivory Spire Cathedral and Flint Forge Quarter. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Riverstone Wharf, Primrose Boulevard, Shadowbridge Arcade, Quarry Point, Dragon’s Gate, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Riverstone Wharf, Beacon Tower, Quarry Point, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Flint Forge Quarter. \nThe Riverstone Wharf has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower, Primrose Boulevard, Velvet Corner, Twilight Harbor, Horizon Mall, Granite Plaza, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Flint Forge Quarter. \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Beacon Tower, Primrose Boulevard, Umbra Theater, Duskwood Park, Zenith Arena, Horizon Mall. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park, Horizon Mall, Dragon’s Gate, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Flint Forge Quarter. \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with Velvet Corner, Cobalt Market, Horizon Mall. \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with Velvet Corner, Umbra Theater, Zenith Arena, Quarry Point, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Velvet Corner has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater, Cobalt Market, Zenith Arena, Shadowbridge Arcade, Quarry Point, Horizon Mall, Granite Plaza, Flint Forge Quarter. \nThe Umbra Theater has overlapping signal areas with Cobalt Market, Duskwood Park, Horizon Mall, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Flint Forge Quarter. \nThe Cobalt Market has overlapping signal areas with Twilight Harbor, Duskwood Park, Shadowbridge Arcade, Horizon Mall, Granite Plaza, Dragon’s Gate, Flint Forge Quarter. \nThe Twilight Harbor has overlapping signal areas with Zenith Arena, Horizon Mall, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Flint Forge Quarter. \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Quarry Point, Horizon Mall, Granite Plaza, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Zenith Arena has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Flint Forge Quarter. \nThe Shadowbridge Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza, Dragon’s Gate, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Flint Forge Quarter. \nThe Quarry Point has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza, Dragon’s Gate, Flint Forge Quarter. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Dragon’s Gate. \nThe Dragon’s Gate has overlapping signal areas with Flint Forge Quarter. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Flint Forge Quarter. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 20 major locations in the city: Ironbridge Crossing, Northwind Tower, Amber Plaza, Quarry Point, Haven Docks, Zenith Arena, Lighthouse Point, Moonlit Promenade, Duskwood Park, Oakshade Library, Dragon’s Gate, Granite Plaza, Shadowbridge Arcade, Nimbus Plaza, Knight’s Market, Twilight Harbor, Quartz District, King’s Row, Gilded Archway and Velvet Corner. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Ironbridge Crossing has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, Amber Plaza, Quarry Point, Haven Docks, Zenith Arena, Moonlit Promenade, Oakshade Library, Dragon’s Gate, Granite Plaza, Twilight Harbor, King’s Row. \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with Amber Plaza, Haven Docks, Zenith Arena, Moonlit Promenade, Duskwood Park, Granite Plaza, Knight’s Market, Quartz District, Velvet Corner. \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Zenith Arena, Moonlit Promenade, Velvet Corner. \nThe Quarry Point has overlapping signal areas with Zenith Arena, Duskwood Park, Oakshade Library, Dragon’s Gate, Shadowbridge Arcade, Quartz District, King’s Row. \nThe Haven Docks has overlapping signal areas with Zenith Arena, Dragon’s Gate, Knight’s Market. \nThe Zenith Arena has overlapping signal areas with Lighthouse Point, Oakshade Library, Granite Plaza, Shadowbridge Arcade, Nimbus Plaza, King’s Row, Velvet Corner. \nThe Lighthouse Point has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park, Oakshade Library, Granite Plaza, Shadowbridge Arcade, Nimbus Plaza, Quartz District, Gilded Archway, Velvet Corner. \nThe Moonlit Promenade has overlapping signal areas with Dragon’s Gate, Nimbus Plaza, Knight’s Market, King’s Row, Gilded Archway. \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Dragon’s Gate, Shadowbridge Arcade, Gilded Archway. \nThe Oakshade Library has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza, Nimbus Plaza, King’s Row, Gilded Archway. \nThe Dragon’s Gate has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza, King’s Row, Gilded Archway. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade, Knight’s Market, Quartz District, King’s Row, Velvet Corner. \nThe Shadowbridge Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Nimbus Plaza, Knight’s Market, Twilight Harbor, King’s Row, Gilded Archway, Velvet Corner. \nThe Nimbus Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Knight’s Market, Quartz District, King’s Row. \nThe Knight’s Market has overlapping signal areas with Twilight Harbor, Velvet Corner. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 20 major locations in the city: Opal Theater, Granite Plaza, Echo Station, Dragon’s Gate, Flare Alley, Westgate Station, Quartz District, Northwind Tower, Sapphire Arena, Horizon Mall, Riverstone Wharf, Beacon Tower, Lighthouse Point, Amber Plaza, Yarrow Plaza, Moonlit Promenade, King’s Row, Brass Lantern Tavern, Silvercrest Observatory and Union Square Market. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Opal Theater has overlapping signal areas with Dragon’s Gate, Flare Alley, Quartz District, Sapphire Arena, Horizon Mall, Beacon Tower, Silvercrest Observatory, Union Square Market. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Dragon’s Gate, Flare Alley, Quartz District, Sapphire Arena, Horizon Mall, Riverstone Wharf, Amber Plaza, King’s Row, Silvercrest Observatory. \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with Flare Alley, Westgate Station, Quartz District, Horizon Mall, Yarrow Plaza. \nThe Dragon’s Gate has overlapping signal areas with Riverstone Wharf, Beacon Tower, Lighthouse Point, Yarrow Plaza, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Riverstone Wharf, Lighthouse Point, Yarrow Plaza, Moonlit Promenade, King’s Row, Union Square Market. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena, Horizon Mall, Riverstone Wharf, Lighthouse Point, Amber Plaza, Moonlit Promenade, King’s Row, Brass Lantern Tavern, Silvercrest Observatory. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena, Lighthouse Point, Yarrow Plaza, Moonlit Promenade, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with Horizon Mall, Riverstone Wharf, Yarrow Plaza, Moonlit Promenade, King’s Row, Silvercrest Observatory. \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower, Lighthouse Point, Yarrow Plaza, Silvercrest Observatory, Union Square Market. \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Lighthouse Point, Amber Plaza, Silvercrest Observatory, Union Square Market. \nThe Riverstone Wharf has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower, Lighthouse Point, King’s Row, Brass Lantern Tavern, Union Square Market. \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with Amber Plaza, Yarrow Plaza, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Lighthouse Point has overlapping signal areas with Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Moonlit Promenade, Brass Lantern Tavern, Union Square Market. \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Moonlit Promenade has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Silvercrest Observatory, Union Square Market. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Union Square Market. \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with Union Square Market. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 20 major locations in the city: Pennywhistle Arcade, Primrose Boulevard, Willowshade Pavilion, Opal Theater, Temple Square, Nimbus Plaza, Union Square Market, Knight’s Market, Amber Plaza, Yarrow Plaza, Oakshade Library, Flint Forge Quarter, Skyline Gardens, Sapphire Arena, Umbra Theater, Ironbridge Crossing, Beacon Tower, Dragon’s Gate, Westgate Station and Velvet Corner. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Primrose Boulevard, Opal Theater, Nimbus Plaza, Yarrow Plaza, Sapphire Arena, Ironbridge Crossing, Velvet Corner. \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Temple Square, Union Square Market, Amber Plaza, Sapphire Arena, Ironbridge Crossing, Beacon Tower. \nThe Willowshade Pavilion has overlapping signal areas with Temple Square, Yarrow Plaza, Oakshade Library, Skyline Gardens, Beacon Tower, Dragon’s Gate, Westgate Station. \nThe Opal Theater has overlapping signal areas with Temple Square, Nimbus Plaza, Yarrow Plaza, Oakshade Library, Flint Forge Quarter, Beacon Tower, Dragon’s Gate. \nThe Temple Square has overlapping signal areas with Nimbus Plaza, Oakshade Library, Flint Forge Quarter, Skyline Gardens, Ironbridge Crossing, Beacon Tower. \nThe Nimbus Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Amber Plaza, Yarrow Plaza, Oakshade Library, Flint Forge Quarter, Umbra Theater, Beacon Tower, Dragon’s Gate, Westgate Station. \nThe Union Square Market has overlapping signal areas with Knight’s Market, Amber Plaza, Oakshade Library, Flint Forge Quarter, Skyline Gardens. \nThe Knight’s Market has overlapping signal areas with Amber Plaza, Yarrow Plaza, Flint Forge Quarter, Umbra Theater, Westgate Station, Velvet Corner. \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Oakshade Library, Flint Forge Quarter, Ironbridge Crossing, Dragon’s Gate, Velvet Corner. \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Oakshade Library, Sapphire Arena, Ironbridge Crossing, Westgate Station. \nThe Oakshade Library has overlapping signal areas with Flint Forge Quarter, Skyline Gardens, Umbra Theater, Ironbridge Crossing, Beacon Tower. \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens, Dragon’s Gate, Velvet Corner. \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater, Dragon’s Gate. \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater, Dragon’s Gate, Velvet Corner. \nThe Umbra Theater has overlapping signal areas with Ironbridge Crossing, Dragon’s Gate, Velvet Corner. \nThe Ironbridge Crossing has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Velvet Corner. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 20 major locations in the city: Willowshade Pavilion, King’s Row, Ironbridge Crossing, Gilded Archway, Dragon’s Gate, Yarrow Plaza, Sapphire Arena, Rosewood Hall, Echo Station, Lighthouse Point, Opal Theater, Lunar Pier, Zenith Arena, Brass Lantern Tavern, Union Square Market, Umbra Theater, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Northwind Tower, Granite Plaza and Flare Alley. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Willowshade Pavilion has overlapping signal areas with Dragon’s Gate, Sapphire Arena, Echo Station, Opal Theater, Lunar Pier, Flare Alley. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway, Rosewood Hall, Echo Station, Opal Theater, Lunar Pier, Zenith Arena, Brass Lantern Tavern, Union Square Market, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Northwind Tower. \nThe Ironbridge Crossing has overlapping signal areas with Dragon’s Gate, Yarrow Plaza, Lunar Pier, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Northwind Tower, Flare Alley. \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, Echo Station, Lighthouse Point, Lunar Pier, Zenith Arena, Brass Lantern Tavern, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Flare Alley. \nThe Dragon’s Gate has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, Rosewood Hall, Lighthouse Point, Opal Theater, Zenith Arena, Granite Plaza. \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Rosewood Hall, Echo Station, Lighthouse Point, Lunar Pier, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Granite Plaza, Flare Alley. \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station, Opal Theater, Lunar Pier, Union Square Market, Umbra Theater, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Northwind Tower, Granite Plaza. \nThe Rosewood Hall has overlapping signal areas with Lighthouse Point, Umbra Theater. \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier, Zenith Arena, Brass Lantern Tavern, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Flare Alley. \nThe Lighthouse Point has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier, Brass Lantern Tavern, Northwind Tower, Flare Alley. \nThe Opal Theater has overlapping signal areas with Zenith Arena, Brass Lantern Tavern, Umbra Theater, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Northwind Tower, Flare Alley. \nThe Lunar Pier has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater, Northwind Tower. \nThe Zenith Arena has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Union Square Market, Umbra Theater, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Union Square Market has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, Flare Alley. \nThe Umbra Theater has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral, Granite Plaza. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 20 major locations in the city: Jade Fountain, Lunar Pier, Skyline Gardens, Quartz District, Jasper Marina, Shadowbridge Arcade, Cobalt Market, Pennywhistle Arcade, King’s Row, Flint Forge Quarter, Gilded Archway, Azure Gardens, Riverstone Wharf, Amber Plaza, Lighthouse Point, Mosaic Plaza, Knight’s Market, Moonlit Promenade, Rosewood Hall and Maplewood Conservatory. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Jade Fountain has overlapping signal areas with Quartz District, Shadowbridge Arcade, King’s Row, Riverstone Wharf, Knight’s Market, Rosewood Hall. \nThe Lunar Pier has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens, Quartz District, Jasper Marina, Cobalt Market, Azure Gardens, Riverstone Wharf, Lighthouse Point, Mosaic Plaza, Rosewood Hall. \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina, Cobalt Market, King’s Row, Flint Forge Quarter, Riverstone Wharf, Mosaic Plaza, Knight’s Market, Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina, Shadowbridge Arcade, Pennywhistle Arcade, Flint Forge Quarter, Gilded Archway, Azure Gardens, Mosaic Plaza, Knight’s Market, Moonlit Promenade, Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Jasper Marina has overlapping signal areas with Cobalt Market, Pennywhistle Arcade, King’s Row, Amber Plaza, Mosaic Plaza, Knight’s Market, Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Shadowbridge Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade, King’s Row, Flint Forge Quarter, Azure Gardens, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Cobalt Market has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade, Azure Gardens, Knight’s Market, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Azure Gardens, Lighthouse Point, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway, Azure Gardens, Riverstone Wharf, Amber Plaza, Rosewood Hall, Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Amber Plaza, Lighthouse Point, Knight’s Market, Rosewood Hall, Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Amber Plaza, Knight’s Market. \nThe Azure Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Riverstone Wharf, Amber Plaza, Lighthouse Point, Knight’s Market, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Riverstone Wharf has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza, Knight’s Market, Rosewood Hall. \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza. \nThe Lighthouse Point has overlapping signal areas with Rosewood Hall, Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Knight’s Market. \nThe Knight’s Market has overlapping signal areas with Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Rosewood Hall has overlapping signal areas with Maplewood Conservatory. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 20 major locations in the city: Silvercrest Observatory, Azure Gardens, Shadowbridge Arcade, Flare Alley, Duskwood Park, Dragon’s Gate, Maplewood Conservatory, Gilded Archway, Quartz District, Cobalt Market, Copper Clock Square, Sapphire Arena, Temple Square, Ironbridge Crossing, Opal Theater, Jasper Marina, Flint Forge Quarter, Evergreen Circle, Mosaic Plaza and Zenith Arena. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with Azure Gardens, Shadowbridge Arcade, Flare Alley, Duskwood Park, Dragon’s Gate, Gilded Archway, Quartz District, Copper Clock Square, Opal Theater, Jasper Marina, Flint Forge Quarter. \nThe Azure Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade, Dragon’s Gate, Gilded Archway, Quartz District, Cobalt Market, Ironbridge Crossing, Flint Forge Quarter, Evergreen Circle. \nThe Shadowbridge Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway, Quartz District, Cobalt Market, Temple Square, Evergreen Circle, Zenith Arena. \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park, Dragon’s Gate, Maplewood Conservatory, Temple Square, Flint Forge Quarter, Evergreen Circle, Mosaic Plaza. \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway, Copper Clock Square, Temple Square, Flint Forge Quarter. \nThe Dragon’s Gate has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway, Cobalt Market, Copper Clock Square, Sapphire Arena, Opal Theater, Evergreen Circle, Mosaic Plaza, Zenith Arena. \nThe Maplewood Conservatory has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway, Cobalt Market, Copper Clock Square, Sapphire Arena, Ironbridge Crossing, Opal Theater. \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena, Jasper Marina, Flint Forge Quarter, Evergreen Circle. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Copper Clock Square, Temple Square, Ironbridge Crossing. \nThe Cobalt Market has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater, Jasper Marina, Flint Forge Quarter, Evergreen Circle. \nThe Copper Clock Square has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina, Flint Forge Quarter, Evergreen Circle, Mosaic Plaza, Zenith Arena. \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with Temple Square, Ironbridge Crossing, Evergreen Circle. \nThe Temple Square has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina, Mosaic Plaza, Zenith Arena. \nThe Ironbridge Crossing has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater, Jasper Marina. \nThe Opal Theater has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina, Zenith Arena. \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Evergreen Circle, Mosaic Plaza. \nThe Evergreen Circle has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza. \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Zenith Arena. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with Maplewood Conservatory, Zenith Arena, Horizon Mall, King’s Row, Westgate Station, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Yarrow Plaza, Skyline Gardens. \nThe Cobalt Market has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier, Quartz District, Nimbus Plaza, Granite Plaza, Horizon Mall, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Yarrow Plaza. \nThe Maplewood Conservatory has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier, Willowshade Pavilion, Flint Forge Quarter, Haven Docks, Jade Fountain, King’s Row, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Yarrow Plaza, Skyline Gardens. \nThe Lunar Pier has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Quartz District, Nimbus Plaza, Haven Docks, Jade Fountain, Northwind Tower, Granite Plaza, Dragon’s Gate, Skyline Gardens. \nThe Willowshade Pavilion has overlapping signal areas with Dragon’s Gate, King’s Row, Westgate Station, Skyline Gardens. \nThe Zenith Arena has overlapping signal areas with Nimbus Plaza, Horizon Mall, Dragon’s Gate, Yarrow Plaza, Skyline Gardens. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Flint Forge Quarter, Nimbus Plaza, Northwind Tower, Granite Plaza, Horizon Mall, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Yarrow Plaza. \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Nimbus Plaza, Haven Docks, Jade Fountain, Horizon Mall, Yarrow Plaza. \nThe Nimbus Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Haven Docks, Jade Fountain, Horizon Mall, Dragon’s Gate, Westgate Station, Yarrow Plaza. \nThe Haven Docks has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza, King’s Row, Westgate Station, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Skyline Gardens. \nThe Jade Fountain has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza. \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with Dragon’s Gate, Yarrow Plaza. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Westgate Station, Skyline Gardens. \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Westgate Station, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Skyline Gardens. \nThe Dragon’s Gate has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Skyline Gardens. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, Skyline Gardens. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza. \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",
