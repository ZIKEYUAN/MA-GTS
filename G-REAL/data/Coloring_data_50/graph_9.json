  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 9 major locations in the city: Ivory Spire Cathedral, Yarrow Plaza, Flint Forge Quarter, Northwind Tower, Cobalt Market, Umbra Theater, Quarry Point, Riverstone Wharf and Opal Theater. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas.

The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 9 major locations in the city: Union Square Market, Primrose Boulevard, Flint Forge Quarter, Opal Theater, Lighthouse Point, Velvet Corner, Beacon Tower, Mosaic Plaza and Quarry Point. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas.

I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Union Square Market has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater, Velvet Corner, Mosaic Plaza, Quarry Point. \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with Flint Forge Quarter, Velvet Corner. \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Velvet Corner, Beacon Tower, Mosaic Plaza, Quarry Point. \nThe Opal Theater has overlapping signal areas with Velvet Corner, Beacon Tower. \nThe Lighthouse Point has overlapping signal areas with Velvet Corner. \nThe Velvet Corner has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza. \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza, Quarry Point. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 9 major locations in the city: Cobalt Market, Gilded Archway, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Lunar Pier, Flare Alley, Temple Square, Umbra Theater, Knight’s Market and Northwind Tower. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Cobalt Market has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater. \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Flare Alley. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier, Northwind Tower. \nThe Lunar Pier has overlapping signal areas with Temple Square, Umbra Theater, Northwind Tower. \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Temple Square, Umbra Theater, Northwind Tower. \nThe Temple Square has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater, Knight’s Market, Northwind Tower. \nThe Umbra Theater has overlapping signal areas with Knight’s Market, Northwind Tower. \nThe Knight’s Market has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 9 major locations in the city: Azure Gardens, Rosewood Hall, Knight’s Market, Opal Theater, King’s Row, Union Square Market, Flare Alley, Ivory Spire Cathedral and Oakshade Library. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas.

I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Moonlit Promenade has overlapping signal areas with Quarry Point, Azure Gardens, Umbra Theater, Evergreen Circle, Amber Plaza, Flint Forge Quarter. \nThe Jasper Marina has overlapping signal areas with Quarry Point, Azure Gardens, Flint Forge Quarter. \nThe Quarry Point has overlapping signal areas with Evergreen Circle, Flint Forge Quarter. \nThe Azure Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Amber Plaza. \nThe Umbra Theater has overlapping signal areas with Evergreen Circle, Amber Plaza. \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway. \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Flint Forge Quarter. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",
