  "Q": "Our company handles deliveries across a busy urban area, and today we have 4 distinct delivery points to cover. The delivery driver will start from our central warehouse and needs to drop off packages at each location before returning to the warehouse. Since these delivery points are scattered throughout different parts of the city, we’re looking to find the most efficient route to minimize the total distance traveled. This will help us save on fuel, reduce delivery times, and improve our overall efficiency.\nThe warehouse, is located near the city center. Each location represents a different type of business or residential area with unique delivery requirements:\nIvory Spire Cathedral: A towering cathedral with stunning stained-glass windows and a melodic bell tower.\nGranite Plaza: A corporate plaza with water fountains and benches, popular among office workers during lunch.\nGilded Archway: A historic landmark leading to the city’s oldest district, adorned with intricate carvings.\nAmber Plaza: A bustling central square surrounded by cafes, boutiques, and street performers.\n\nEach pair of points has a different travel distance between them, based on city traffic patterns and street layouts. Here is the distance table showing the approximate distance (in kilometers) between each pair of locations:\nDistances from Warehouse to each delivery point: Warehouse to Ivory Spire Cathedral is 9 km, Warehouse to Granite Plaza is 6 km, Warehouse to Gilded Archway is 7 km, Warehouse to Amber Plaza is 1 km.\nDistances from Delivery Ivory Spire Cathedral to each delivery point: Ivory Spire Cathedral to Granite Plaza is 10 km, Ivory Spire Cathedral to Gilded Archway is 4 km, Ivory Spire Cathedral to Amber Plaza is 6 km.\nDistances from Delivery Granite Plaza to each delivery point: Granite Plaza to Gilded Archway is 4 km, Granite Plaza to Amber Plaza is 6 km.\nDistances from Delivery Gilded Archway to each delivery point: Gilded Archway to Amber Plaza is 6 km.\n\nBased on this distance table, we need to determine the optimal delivery route that allows the driver to start from the warehouse, visit each delivery point exactly once, and return to warehouse with the shortest possible total distance.",

  "Q": "Our company handles deliveries across a busy urban area, and today we have 4 distinct delivery points to cover. The delivery driver will start from our central warehouse and needs to drop off packages at each location before returning to the warehouse. Since these delivery points are scattered throughout different parts of the city, we’re looking to find the most efficient route to minimize the total distance traveled. This will help us save on fuel, reduce delivery times, and improve our overall efficiency.\nThe warehouse, is located near the city center. Each location represents a different type of business or residential area with unique delivery requirements:\nSkyline Gardens: A rooftop garden atop the central mall, offering breathtaking views and quiet retreats.\nBeacon Tower: The tallest building in the city, offering panoramic views and a rotating rooftop restaurant.\nPrimrose Boulevard: A tree-lined street with boutique stores, local bakeries, and street performers.\nWillowshade Pavilion: A cultural pavilion hosting open-air art exhibits, food festivals, and community events.\n\nEach pair of points has a different travel distance between them, based on city traffic patterns and street layouts. Here is the distance table showing the approximate distance (in kilometers) between each pair of locations:\nDistances from Warehouse to each delivery point: Warehouse to Skyline Gardens is 4 km, Warehouse to Beacon Tower is 9 km, Warehouse to Primrose Boulevard is 8 km, Warehouse to Willowshade Pavilion is 4 km.\nDistances from Delivery Skyline Gardens to each delivery point: Skyline Gardens to Beacon Tower is 9 km, Skyline Gardens to Primrose Boulevard is 1 km, Skyline Gardens to Willowshade Pavilion is 8 km.\nDistances from Delivery Beacon Tower to each delivery point: Beacon Tower to Primrose Boulevard is 3 km, Beacon Tower to Willowshade Pavilion is 5 km.\nDistances from Delivery Primrose Boulevard to each delivery point: Primrose Boulevard to Willowshade Pavilion is 6 km.\n\nBased on this distance table, we need to determine the optimal delivery route that allows the driver to start from the warehouse, visit each delivery point exactly once, and return to warehouse with the shortest possible total distance.",
