  "Q": "Our company handles deliveries across a busy urban area, and today we have 10 distinct delivery points to cover. The delivery driver will start from our central warehouse and needs to drop off packages at each location before returning to the warehouse. Since these delivery points are scattered throughout different parts of the city, we’re looking to find the most efficient route to minimize the total distance traveled. This will help us save on fuel, reduce delivery times, and improve our overall efficiency.\nThe warehouse, is located near the city center. Each location represents a different type of business or residential area with unique delivery requirements:\nFlint Forge Quarter: An old industrial area now revitalized with art studios and trendy cafes.\nUnion Square Market: A farmers’ market offering fresh produce, handmade crafts, and live music.\nKnight’s Market: A medieval-themed marketplace with handcrafted goods and costumed vendors.\nNorthwind Tower: A modern skyscraper with a rotating observation deck and sky-high dining.\nIronbridge Crossing: A massive steel bridge connecting the industrial zone with the city center.\nIvory Spire Cathedral: A towering cathedral with stunning stained-glass windows and a melodic bell tower.\nWillowshade Pavilion: A cultural pavilion hosting open-air art exhibits, food festivals, and community events.\nCobalt Market: A vibrant marketplace where merchants sell exotic goods and fresh produce from all over.\nOpal Theater: An avant-garde cinema showing independent films and hosting film festivals.\nRiverstone Wharf: A bustling area along the river, known for its floating markets and seafood restaurants.\n\nEach pair of points has a different travel distance between them, based on city traffic patterns and street layouts.

  "Q": "Our company handles deliveries across a busy urban area, and today we have 10 distinct delivery points to cover. The delivery driver will start from our central warehouse and needs to drop off packages at each location before returning to the warehouse. Since these delivery points are scattered throughout different parts of the city, we’re looking to find the most efficient route to minimize the total distance traveled. This will help us save on fuel, reduce delivery times, and improve our overall efficiency.\nThe warehouse, is located near the city center. Each location represents a different type of business or residential area with unique delivery requirements:\nKing’s Row: A luxurious shopping street lined with high-end stores and designer boutiques.\nShadowbridge Arcade: A covered walkway filled with specialty stores, cafes, and hidden speakeasies.\nDragon’s Gate: An iconic stone gate marking the entrance to the vibrant Chinatown district.\nBrass Lantern Tavern: A cozy pub famous for its handcrafted beers and warm, rustic interiors.\nMoonlit Promenade: A romantic walkway along the riverbank, lit by soft lanterns at night.\nNorthwind Tower: A modern skyscraper with a rotating observation deck and sky-high dining.\nEcho Station: The city’s largest transportation hub, always alive with the sound of trains and announcements.\nFlare Alley: A narrow, colorful street lined with neon-lit bars and underground clubs.\nCopper Clock Square: A historic plaza with a towering clock surrounded by antique shops and cafes.\nBeacon Tower: The tallest building in the city, offering panoramic views and a rotating rooftop restaurant.\n\nEach pair of points has a different travel distance between them, based on city traffic patterns and street layouts. Here is the distance table showing the approximate distance (in kilometers) between each pair of locations:\nDistances from Warehouse to each delivery point: Warehouse to King’s Row is 1 km, Warehouse to Shadowbridge Arcade is 5 km, Warehouse to Dragon’s Gate is 5 km, Warehouse to Brass Lantern Tavern is 5 km, Warehouse to Moonlit Promenade is 10 km, Warehouse to Northwind Tower is 5 km, Warehouse to Echo Station is 2 km, Warehouse to Flare Alley is 9 km, Warehouse to Copper Clock Square is 7 km, Warehouse to Beacon Tower is 4 km.\nDistances from Delivery King’s Row to each delivery point: King’s Row to Shadowbridge Arcade is 4 km, King’s Row to Dragon’s Gate is 5 km, King’s Row to Brass Lantern Tavern is 7 km, King’s Row to Moonlit Promenade is 1 km, King’s Row to Northwind Tower is 8 km, King’s Row to Echo Station is 7 km, King’s Row to Flare Alley is 6 km, King’s Row to Copper Clock Square is 4 km, King’s Row to Beacon Tower is 6 km.\nDistances from Delivery Shadowbridge Arcade to each delivery point: Shadowbridge Arcade to Dragon’s Gate is 10 km, Shadowbridge Arcade to Brass Lantern Tavern is 7 km, Shadowbridge Arcade to Moonlit Promenade is 10 km, Shadowbridge Arcade to Northwind Tower is 4 km, Shadowbridge Arcade to Echo Station is 9 km, Shadowbridge Arcade to Flare Alley is 2 km, Shadowbridge Arcade to Copper Clock Square is 9 km, Shadowbridge Arcade to Beacon Tower is 10 km.\nDistances from Delivery Dragon’s Gate to each delivery point: Dragon’s Gate to Brass Lantern Tavern is 3 km, Dragon’s Gate to Moonlit Promenade is 1 km, Dragon’s Gate to Northwind Tower is 8 km, Dragon’s Gate to Echo Station is 2 km, Dragon’s Gate to Flare Alley is 1 km, Dragon’s Gate to Copper Clock Square is 10 km, Dragon’s Gate to Beacon Tower is 9 km.\nDistances from Delivery Brass Lantern Tavern to each delivery point: Brass Lantern Tavern to Moonlit Promenade is 8 km, Brass Lantern Tavern to Northwind Tower is 8 km, Brass Lantern Tavern to Echo Station is 6 km, Brass Lantern Tavern to Flare Alley is 2 km, Brass Lantern Tavern to Copper Clock Square is 1 km, Brass Lantern Tavern to Beacon Tower is 9 km.\nDistances from Delivery Moonlit Promenade to each delivery point: Moonlit Promenade to Northwind Tower is 7 km, Moonlit Promenade to Echo Station is 5 km, Moonlit Promenade to Flare Alley is 2 km, Moonlit Promenade to Copper Clock Square is 9 km, Moonlit Promenade to Beacon Tower is 1 km.\nDistances from Delivery Northwind Tower to each delivery point: Northwind Tower to Echo Station is 1 km, Northwind Tower to Flare Alley is 3 km, Northwind Tower to Copper Clock Square is 10 km, Northwind Tower to Beacon Tower is 8 km.\nDistances from Delivery Echo Station to each delivery point: Echo Station to Flare Alley is 5 km, Echo Station to Copper Clock Square is 10 km, Echo Station to Beacon Tower is 3 km.\nDistances from Delivery Flare Alley to each delivery point: Flare Alley to Copper Clock Square is 9 km, Flare Alley to Beacon Tower is 9 km.\nDistances from Delivery Copper Clock Square to each delivery point: Copper Clock Square to Beacon Tower is 9 km.\n\nBased on this distance table, we need to determine the optimal delivery route that allows the driver to start from the warehouse, visit each delivery point exactly once, and return to warehouse with the shortest possible total distance.",
