  "Q": "Our company handles deliveries across a busy urban area, and today we have 7 distinct delivery points to cover. The delivery driver will start from our central warehouse and needs to drop off packages at each location before returning to the warehouse. Since these delivery points are scattered throughout different parts of the city, we’re looking to find the most efficient route to minimize the total distance traveled. This will help us save on fuel, reduce delivery times, and improve our overall efficiency.\nThe warehouse, is located near the city center. Each location represents a different type of business or residential area with unique delivery requirements:\nJasper Marina: A sleek marina hosting luxury yachts, seafood dining, and weekend sailing lessons.\nOpal Theater: An avant-garde cinema showing independent films and hosting film festivals.\nBeacon Tower: The tallest building in the city, offering panoramic views and a rotating rooftop restaurant.\nPennywhistle Arcade: A vintage entertainment district with old-style theaters, arcades, and street performers.\nNimbus Plaza: A futuristic square surrounded by glass skyscrapers and interactive digital art installations.\nMosaic Plaza: A public square adorned with colorful tile art and surrounded by artisan coffee shops.\nVelvet Corner: A hidden alley filled with cozy cafes, second-hand bookstores, and intimate music venues.\n\nEach pair of points has a different travel distance between them, based on city traffic patterns and street layouts. Here is the distance table showing the approximate distance (in kilometers) between each pair of locations:\nDistances from Warehouse to each delivery point: Warehouse to Jasper Marina is 1 km, Warehouse to Opal Theater is 2 km, Warehouse to Beacon Tower is 3 km, Warehouse to Pennywhistle Arcade is 1 km, Warehouse to Nimbus Plaza is 1 km, Warehouse to Mosaic Plaza is 5 km, Warehouse to Velvet Corner is 10 km.\nDistances from Delivery Jasper Marina to each delivery point: Jasper Marina to Opal Theater is 6 km, Jasper Marina to Beacon Tower is 8 km, Jasper Marina to Pennywhistle Arcade is 3 km, Jasper Marina to Nimbus Plaza is 10 km, Jasper Marina to Mosaic Plaza is 2 km, Jasper Marina to Velvet Corner is 9 km.\nDistances from Delivery Opal Theater to each delivery point: Opal Theater to Beacon Tower is 2 km, Opal Theater to Pennywhistle Arcade is 4 km, Opal Theater to Nimbus Plaza is 7 km, Opal Theater to Mosaic Plaza is 9 km, Opal Theater to Velvet Corner is 1 km.\nDistances from Delivery Beacon Tower to each delivery point: Beacon Tower to Pennywhistle Arcade is 8 km, Beacon Tower to Nimbus Plaza is 5 km, Beacon Tower to Mosaic Plaza is 7 km, Beacon Tower to Velvet Corner is 1 km.\nDistances from Delivery Pennywhistle Arcade to each delivery point: Pennywhistle Arcade to Nimbus Plaza is 9 km, Pennywhistle Arcade to Mosaic Plaza is 4 km, Pennywhistle Arcade to Velvet Corner is 4 km.\nDistances from Delivery Nimbus Plaza to each delivery point: Nimbus Plaza to Mosaic Plaza is 7 km, Nimbus Plaza to Velvet Corner is 5 km.\nDistances from Delivery Mosaic Plaza to each delivery point: Mosaic Plaza to Velvet Corner is 1 km.\n\nBased on this distance table, we need to determine the optimal delivery route that allows the driver to start from the warehouse, visit each delivery point exactly once, and return to warehouse with the shortest possible total distance.",

  "Q": "Our company handles deliveries across a busy urban area, and today we have 7 distinct delivery points to cover. The delivery driver will start from our central warehouse and needs to drop off packages at each location before returning to the warehouse.

This will help us save on fuel, reduce delivery times, and improve our overall efficiency.\nThe warehouse, is located near the city center. Each location represents a different type of business or residential area with unique delivery requirements:\nUmbra Theater: A grand opera house with velvet interiors and a reputation for world-class performances.\nBrass Lantern Tavern: A cozy pub famous for its handcrafted beers and warm, rustic interiors.\nLighthouse Point: A scenic overlook by the bay with a historic lighthouse and picnic spots.\nFlint Forge Quarter: An old industrial area now revitalized with art studios and trendy cafes.\nFlare Alley: A narrow, colorful street lined with neon-lit bars and underground clubs.\nDragon’s Gate: An iconic stone gate marking the entrance to the vibrant Chinatown district.\nOpal Theater: An avant-garde cinema showing independent films and hosting film festivals.\n\nEach pair of points has a different travel distance between them, based on city traffic patterns and street layouts.

  "Q": "Our company handles deliveries across a busy urban area, and today we have 7 distinct delivery points to cover. The delivery driver will start from our central warehouse and needs to drop off packages at each location before returning to the warehouse. Since these delivery points are scattered throughout different parts of the city, we’re looking to find the most efficient route to minimize the total distance traveled. This will help us save on fuel, reduce delivery times, and improve our overall efficiency.\nThe warehouse, is located near the city center. Each location represents a different type of business or residential area with unique delivery requirements:\nLighthouse Point: A scenic overlook by the bay with a historic lighthouse and picnic spots.\nOakshade Library: The city’s largest library, featuring towering bookshelves and cozy reading nooks.\nFlare Alley: A narrow, colorful street lined with neon-lit bars and underground clubs.\nJasper Marina: A sleek marina hosting luxury yachts, seafood dining, and weekend sailing lessons.\nJade Fountain: A tranquil plaza centered around a beautiful fountain made of green stone.\nMoonlit Promenade: A romantic walkway along the riverbank, lit by soft lanterns at night.\nSkyline Gardens: A rooftop garden atop the central mall, offering breathtaking views and quiet retreats.\n\nEach pair of points has a different travel distance between them, based on city traffic patterns and street layouts. Here is the distance table showing the approximate distance (in kilometers) between each pair of locations:\nDistances from Warehouse to each delivery point: Warehouse to Lighthouse Point is 7 km, Warehouse to Oakshade Library is 2 km, Warehouse to Flare Alley is 6 km, Warehouse to Jasper Marina is 8 km, Warehouse to Jade Fountain is 5 km, Warehouse to Moonlit Promenade is 9 km, Warehouse to Skyline Gardens is 10 km.\nDistances from Delivery Lighthouse Point to each delivery point: Lighthouse Point to Oakshade Library is 2 km, Lighthouse Point to Flare Alley is 10 km, Lighthouse Point to Jasper Marina is 6 km, Lighthouse Point to Jade Fountain is 6 km, Lighthouse Point to Moonlit Promenade is 4 km, Lighthouse Point to Skyline Gardens is 7 km.\nDistances from Delivery Oakshade Library to each delivery point: Oakshade Library to Flare Alley is 9 km, Oakshade Library to Jasper Marina is 3 km, Oakshade Library to Jade Fountain is 6 km, Oakshade Library to Moonlit Promenade is 9 km, Oakshade Library to Skyline Gardens is 6 km.\nDistances from Delivery Flare Alley to each delivery point: Flare Alley to Jasper Marina is 9 km, Flare Alley to Jade Fountain is 4 km, Flare Alley to Moonlit Promenade is 10 km, Flare Alley to Skyline Gardens is 2 km.\nDistances from Delivery Jasper Marina to each delivery point: Jasper Marina to Jade Fountain is 1 km, Jasper Marina to Moonlit Promenade is 6 km, Jasper Marina to Skyline Gardens is 2 km.\nDistances from Delivery Jade Fountain to each delivery point: Jade Fountain to Moonlit Promenade is 2 km, Jade Fountain to Skyline Gardens is 4 km.\nDistances from Delivery Moonlit Promenade to each delivery point: Moonlit Promenade to Skyline Gardens is 4 km.\n\nBased on this distance table, we need to determine the optimal delivery route that allows the driver to start from the warehouse, visit each delivery point exactly once, and return to warehouse with the shortest possible total distance.",

  "Q": "Our company handles deliveries across a busy urban area, and today we have 7 distinct delivery points to cover. The delivery driver will start from our central warehouse and needs to drop off packages at each location before returning to the warehouse. Since these delivery points are scattered throughout different parts of the city, we’re looking to find the most efficient route to minimize the total distance traveled. This will help us save on fuel, reduce delivery times, and improve our overall efficiency.\nThe warehouse, is located near the city center. Each location represents a different type of business or residential area with unique delivery requirements:\nCopper Clock Square: A historic plaza with a towering clock surrounded by antique shops and cafes.\nDuskwood Park: A sprawling urban park filled with dense trees, walking trails, and a serene lake.\nSkyline Gardens: A rooftop garden atop the central mall, offering breathtaking views and quiet retreats.\nPennywhistle Arcade: A vintage entertainment district with old-style theaters, arcades, and street performers.\nMosaic Plaza: A public square adorned with colorful tile art and surrounded by artisan coffee shops.\nTwilight Harbor: A picturesque dock area with twinkling lights and waterfront dining.\nMoonlit Promenade: A romantic walkway along the riverbank, lit by soft lanterns at night.\n\nEach pair of points has a different travel distance between them, based on city traffic patterns and street layouts. Here is the distance table showing the approximate distance (in kilometers) between each pair of locations:\nDistances from Warehouse to each delivery point: Warehouse to Copper Clock Square is 1 km, Warehouse to Duskwood Park is 9 km, Warehouse to Skyline Gardens is 3 km, Warehouse to Pennywhistle Arcade is 4 km, Warehouse to Mosaic Plaza is 3 km, Warehouse to Twilight Harbor is 9 km, Warehouse to Moonlit Promenade is 8 km.\nDistances from Delivery Copper Clock Square to each delivery point: Copper Clock Square to Duskwood Park is 4 km, Copper Clock Square to Skyline Gardens is 1 km, Copper Clock Square to Pennywhistle Arcade is 8 km, Copper Clock Square to Mosaic Plaza is 9 km, Copper Clock Square to Twilight Harbor is 4 km, Copper Clock Square to Moonlit Promenade is 7 km.\nDistances from Delivery Duskwood Park to each delivery point: Duskwood Park to Skyline Gardens is 7 km, Duskwood Park to Pennywhistle Arcade is 1 km, Duskwood Park to Mosaic Plaza is 1 km, Duskwood Park to Twilight Harbor is 9 km, Duskwood Park to Moonlit Promenade is 7 km.\nDistances from Delivery Skyline Gardens to each delivery point: Skyline Gardens to Pennywhistle Arcade is 2 km, Skyline Gardens to Mosaic Plaza is 6 km, Skyline Gardens to Twilight Harbor is 10 km, Skyline Gardens to Moonlit Promenade is 5 km.\nDistances from Delivery Pennywhistle Arcade to each delivery point: Pennywhistle Arcade to Mosaic Plaza is 9 km, Pennywhistle Arcade to Twilight Harbor is 1 km, Pennywhistle Arcade to Moonlit Promenade is 6 km.\nDistances from Delivery Mosaic Plaza to each delivery point: Mosaic Plaza to Twilight Harbor is 4 km, Mosaic Plaza to Moonlit Promenade is 6 km.\nDistances from Delivery Twilight Harbor to each delivery point: Twilight Harbor to Moonlit Promenade is 6 km.\n\nBased on this distance table, we need to determine the optimal delivery route that allows the driver to start from the warehouse, visit each delivery point exactly once, and return to warehouse with the shortest possible total distance.",

  "Q": "Our company handles deliveries across a busy urban area, and today we have 7 distinct delivery points to cover. The delivery driver will start from our central warehouse and needs to drop off packages at each location before returning to the warehouse.

This will help us save on fuel, reduce delivery times, and improve our overall efficiency.\nThe warehouse, is located near the city center. Each location represents a different type of business or residential area with unique delivery requirements:\nVelvet Corner: A hidden alley filled with cozy cafes, second-hand bookstores, and intimate music venues.\nMaplewood Conservatory: A sprawling indoor botanical garden with exotic plants and tranquil waterfalls.\nBeacon Tower: The tallest building in the city, offering panoramic views and a rotating rooftop restaurant.\nPrimrose Boulevard: A tree-lined street with boutique stores, local bakeries, and street performers.\nCobalt Market: A vibrant marketplace where merchants sell exotic goods and fresh produce from all over.\nHorizon Mall: A massive indoor shopping center with everything from luxury brands to casual dining.\nHaven Docks: The city’s bustling port area, filled with cargo ships, seafood stalls, and lively taverns.\n\nEach pair of points has a different travel distance between them, based on city traffic patterns and street layouts.

  "Q": "Our company handles deliveries across a busy urban area, and today we have 7 distinct delivery points to cover. The delivery driver will start from our central warehouse and needs to drop off packages at each location before returning to the warehouse.

This will help us save on fuel, reduce delivery times, and improve our overall efficiency.\nThe warehouse, is located near the city center. Each location represents a different type of business or residential area with unique delivery requirements:\nFlint Forge Quarter: An old industrial area now revitalized with art studios and trendy cafes.\nHorizon Mall: A massive indoor shopping center with everything from luxury brands to casual dining.\nSilvercrest Observatory: A high-tech observatory where visitors can stargaze and learn about astronomy.\nRosewood Hall: A grand event hall hosting galas, weddings, and large conferences.\nDuskwood Park: A sprawling urban park filled with dense trees, walking trails, and a serene lake.\nOakshade Library: The city’s largest library, featuring towering bookshelves and cozy reading nooks.\nLunar Pier: A picturesque wooden pier with food stalls, fishing spots, and a small amusement park.\n\nEach pair of points has a different travel distance between them, based on city traffic patterns and street layouts.

  "Q": "Our company handles deliveries across a busy urban area, and today we have 7 distinct delivery points to cover. The delivery driver will start from our central warehouse and needs to drop off packages at each location before returning to the warehouse. Since these delivery points are scattered throughout different parts of the city, we’re looking to find the most efficient route to minimize the total distance traveled. This will help us save on fuel, reduce delivery times, and improve our overall efficiency.\nThe warehouse, is located near the city center. Each location represents a different type of business or residential area with unique delivery requirements:\nTwilight Harbor: A picturesque dock area with twinkling lights and waterfront dining.\nAzure Gardens: An expansive botanical garden featuring rare plants, greenhouses, and water features.\nSkyline Gardens: A rooftop garden atop the central mall, offering breathtaking views and quiet retreats.\nBeacon Tower: The tallest building in the city, offering panoramic views and a rotating rooftop restaurant.\nPrimrose Boulevard: A tree-lined street with boutique stores, local bakeries, and street performers.\nTemple Square: A historic site featuring a grand temple surrounded by artisan shops and open courtyards.\nLighthouse Point: A scenic overlook by the bay with a historic lighthouse and picnic spots.\n\nEach pair of points has a different travel distance between them, based on city traffic patterns and street layouts. Here is the distance table showing the approximate distance (in kilometers) between each pair of locations:\nDistances from Warehouse to each delivery point: Warehouse to Twilight Harbor is 1 km, Warehouse to Azure Gardens is 4 km, Warehouse to Skyline Gardens is 3 km, Warehouse to Beacon Tower is 9 km, Warehouse to Primrose Boulevard is 4 km, Warehouse to Temple Square is 6 km, Warehouse to Lighthouse Point is 6 km.\nDistances from Delivery Twilight Harbor to each delivery point: Twilight Harbor to Azure Gardens is 9 km, Twilight Harbor to Skyline Gardens is 4 km, Twilight Harbor to Beacon Tower is 3 km, Twilight Harbor to Primrose Boulevard is 1 km, Twilight Harbor to Temple Square is 4 km, Twilight Harbor to Lighthouse Point is 1 km.\nDistances from Delivery Azure Gardens to each delivery point: Azure Gardens to Skyline Gardens is 7 km, Azure Gardens to Beacon Tower is 10 km, Azure Gardens to Primrose Boulevard is 7 km, Azure Gardens to Temple Square is 3 km, Azure Gardens to Lighthouse Point is 9 km.\nDistances from Delivery Skyline Gardens to each delivery point: Skyline Gardens to Beacon Tower is 7 km, Skyline Gardens to Primrose Boulevard is 6 km, Skyline Gardens to Temple Square is 5 km, Skyline Gardens to Lighthouse Point is 3 km.\nDistances from Delivery Beacon Tower to each delivery point: Beacon Tower to Primrose Boulevard is 10 km, Beacon Tower to Temple Square is 3 km, Beacon Tower to Lighthouse Point is 1 km.\nDistances from Delivery Primrose Boulevard to each delivery point: Primrose Boulevard to Temple Square is 8 km, Primrose Boulevard to Lighthouse Point is 1 km.\nDistances from Delivery Temple Square to each delivery point: Temple Square to Lighthouse Point is 5 km.\n\nBased on this distance table, we need to determine the optimal delivery route that allows the driver to start from the warehouse, visit each delivery point exactly once, and return to warehouse with the shortest possible total distance.",

  "Q": "Our company handles deliveries across a busy urban area, and today we have 7 distinct delivery points to cover. The delivery driver will start from our central warehouse and needs to drop off packages at each location before returning to the warehouse. Since these delivery points are scattered throughout different parts of the city, we’re looking to find the most efficient route to minimize the total distance traveled. This will help us save on fuel, reduce delivery times, and improve our overall efficiency.\nThe warehouse, is located near the city center. Each location represents a different type of business or residential area with unique delivery requirements:\nVelvet Corner: A hidden alley filled with cozy cafes, second-hand bookstores, and intimate music venues.\nLunar Pier: A picturesque wooden pier with food stalls, fishing spots, and a small amusement park.\nOakshade Library: The city’s largest library, featuring towering bookshelves and cozy reading nooks.\nNorthwind Tower: A modern skyscraper with a rotating observation deck and sky-high dining.\nLighthouse Point: A scenic overlook by the bay with a historic lighthouse and picnic spots.\nQuartz District: A modern financial center with sleek skyscrapers and luxury dining establishments.\nShadowbridge Arcade: A covered walkway filled with specialty stores, cafes, and hidden speakeasies.\n\nEach pair of points has a different travel distance between them, based on city traffic patterns and street layouts.
