  "Q": "Our company handles deliveries across a busy urban area, and today we have 5 distinct delivery points to cover. The delivery driver will start from our central warehouse and needs to drop off packages at each location before returning to the warehouse. Since these delivery points are scattered throughout different parts of the city, we’re looking to find the most efficient route to minimize the total distance traveled. This will help us save on fuel, reduce delivery times, and improve our overall efficiency.\nThe warehouse, is located near the city center.

  "Q": "Our company handles deliveries across a busy urban area, and today we have 5 distinct delivery points to cover. The delivery driver will start from our central warehouse and needs to drop off packages at each location before returning to the warehouse. Since these delivery points are scattered throughout different parts of the city, we’re looking to find the most efficient route to minimize the total distance traveled. This will help us save on fuel, reduce delivery times, and improve our overall efficiency.\nThe warehouse, is located near the city center. Each location represents a different type of business or residential area with unique delivery requirements:\nRiverstone Wharf: A bustling area along the river, known for its floating markets and seafood restaurants.\nEvergreen Circle: A quiet residential park with a children’s playground and small community events.\nIronbridge Crossing: A massive steel bridge connecting the industrial zone with the city center.\nFlare Alley: A narrow, colorful street lined with neon-lit bars and underground clubs.\nUmbra Theater: A grand opera house with velvet interiors and a reputation for world-class performances.\n\nEach pair of points has a different travel distance between them, based on city traffic patterns and street layouts. Here is the distance table showing the approximate distance (in kilometers) between each pair of locations:\nDistances from Warehouse to each delivery point: Warehouse to Riverstone Wharf is 8 km, Warehouse to Evergreen Circle is 4 km, Warehouse to Ironbridge Crossing is 3 km, Warehouse to Flare Alley is 1 km, Warehouse to Umbra Theater is 6 km.\nDistances from Delivery Riverstone Wharf to each delivery point: Riverstone Wharf to Evergreen Circle is 4 km, Riverstone Wharf to Ironbridge Crossing is 2 km, Riverstone Wharf to Flare Alley is 7 km, Riverstone Wharf to Umbra Theater is 10 km.\nDistances from Delivery Evergreen Circle to each delivery point: Evergreen Circle to Ironbridge Crossing is 6 km, Evergreen Circle to Flare Alley is 4 km, Evergreen Circle to Umbra Theater is 3 km.\nDistances from Delivery Ironbridge Crossing to each delivery point: Ironbridge Crossing to Flare Alley is 6 km, Ironbridge Crossing to Umbra Theater is 1 km.\nDistances from Delivery Flare Alley to each delivery point: Flare Alley to Umbra Theater is 5 km.\n\nBased on this distance table, we need to determine the optimal delivery route that allows the driver to start from the warehouse, visit each delivery point exactly once, and return to warehouse with the shortest possible total distance.",

  "Q": "Our company handles deliveries across a busy urban area, and today we have 5 distinct delivery points to cover. The delivery driver will start from our central warehouse and needs to drop off packages at each location before returning to the warehouse.

  "Q": "Our company handles deliveries across a busy urban area, and today we have 5 distinct delivery points to cover. The delivery driver will start from our central warehouse and needs to drop off packages at each location before returning to the warehouse.

This will help us save on fuel, reduce delivery times, and improve our overall efficiency.\nThe warehouse, is located near the city center.

Each location represents a different type of business or residential area with unique delivery requirements:\nJade Fountain: A tranquil plaza centered around a beautiful fountain made of green stone.\nSapphire Arena: A massive sports and concert venue surrounded by restaurants and fan zones.\nRosewood Hall: A grand event hall hosting galas, weddings, and large conferences.\nUnion Square Market: A farmers’ market offering fresh produce, handmade crafts, and live music.\nTwilight Harbor: A picturesque dock area with twinkling lights and waterfront dining.\n\nEach pair of points has a different travel distance between them, based on city traffic patterns and street layouts. Here is the distance table showing the approximate distance (in kilometers) between each pair of locations:\nDistances from Warehouse to each delivery point: Warehouse to Jade Fountain is 9 km, Warehouse to Sapphire Arena is 1 km, Warehouse to Rosewood Hall is 10 km, Warehouse to Union Square Market is 10 km, Warehouse to Twilight Harbor is 7 km.\nDistances from Delivery Jade Fountain to each delivery point: Jade Fountain to Sapphire Arena is 2 km, Jade Fountain to Rosewood Hall is 9 km, Jade Fountain to Union Square Market is 4 km, Jade Fountain to Twilight Harbor is 3 km.\nDistances from Delivery Sapphire Arena to each delivery point: Sapphire Arena to Rosewood Hall is 10 km, Sapphire Arena to Union Square Market is 5 km, Sapphire Arena to Twilight Harbor is 7 km.\nDistances from Delivery Rosewood Hall to each delivery point: Rosewood Hall to Union Square Market is 4 km, Rosewood Hall to Twilight Harbor is 5 km.\nDistances from Delivery Union Square Market to each delivery point: Union Square Market to Twilight Harbor is 8 km.\n\nBased on this distance table, we need to determine the optimal delivery route that allows the driver to start from the warehouse, visit each delivery point exactly once, and return to warehouse with the shortest possible total distance.",

  "Q": "Our company handles deliveries across a busy urban area, and today we have 5 distinct delivery points to cover. The delivery driver will start from our central warehouse and needs to drop off packages at each location before returning to the warehouse.

Each location represents a different type of business or residential area with unique delivery requirements:\nBeacon Tower: The tallest building in the city, offering panoramic views and a rotating rooftop restaurant.\nMoonlit Promenade: A romantic walkway along the riverbank, lit by soft lanterns at night.\nHaven Docks: The city’s bustling port area, filled with cargo ships, seafood stalls, and lively taverns.\nNimbus Plaza: A futuristic square surrounded by glass skyscrapers and interactive digital art installations.\nDuskwood Park: A sprawling urban park filled with dense trees, walking trails, and a serene lake.\n\nEach pair of points has a different travel distance between them, based on city traffic patterns and street layouts. Here is the distance table showing the approximate distance (in kilometers) between each pair of locations:\nDistances from Warehouse to each delivery point: Warehouse to Beacon Tower is 6 km, Warehouse to Moonlit Promenade is 8 km, Warehouse to Haven Docks is 2 km, Warehouse to Nimbus Plaza is 4 km, Warehouse to Duskwood Park is 4 km.\nDistances from Delivery Beacon Tower to each delivery point: Beacon Tower to Moonlit Promenade is 2 km, Beacon Tower to Haven Docks is 3 km, Beacon Tower to Nimbus Plaza is 4 km, Beacon Tower to Duskwood Park is 5 km.\nDistances from Delivery Moonlit Promenade to each delivery point: Moonlit Promenade to Haven Docks is 10 km, Moonlit Promenade to Nimbus Plaza is 2 km, Moonlit Promenade to Duskwood Park is 5 km.\nDistances from Delivery Haven Docks to each delivery point: Haven Docks to Nimbus Plaza is 8 km, Haven Docks to Duskwood Park is 10 km.\nDistances from Delivery Nimbus Plaza to each delivery point: Nimbus Plaza to Duskwood Park is 8 km.\n\nBased on this distance table, we need to determine the optimal delivery route that allows the driver to start from the warehouse, visit each delivery point exactly once, and return to warehouse with the shortest possible total distance.",
