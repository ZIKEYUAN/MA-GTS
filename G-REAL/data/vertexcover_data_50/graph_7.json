These computers are named: Server Vortex, Server Emberfall, Server Lighthouse, Server Firestorm, Server Skyhawk, Server Thunderstrike and Server Silverstone. \nTo ensure network security, we need to install monitoring devices (such as firewalls or intrusion detection systems) on some of these computers so that all communication links are monitored. \nAssume that the connections between the computers (i.e., the communication links) are bidirectional. This means that information can flow in both directions across any link. Our goal is to deploy monitoring devices in a way that ensures all communication links are covered by at least one monitoring device. \nProblem: How can we select the minimum number of computers to deploy monitoring devices, such that every communication link is monitored by at least one device? \nCommunication links as follows: : \nServer Vortex is connected with Server Firestorm, Server Skyhawk, Server Thunderstrike. \nServer Emberfall is connected with Server Skyhawk, Server Thunderstrike, Server Silverstone. \nServer Firestorm is connected with Server Thunderstrike, Server Silverstone. \nServer Skyhawk is connected with Server Silverstone. \n",
