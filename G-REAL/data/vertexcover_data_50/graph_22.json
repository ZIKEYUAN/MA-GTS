  "Q": "Our company has 22 computers connected by several communication links. These computers are named: Server Blackwood, Server Twilight, Server Nightshade, Server Sunflower, Server Darkhorse, Server Seabreeze, Server Ironclad, Server Emberfall, Server Frostmoon, Server Skyhawk, Server Stormcloud, Server Thunderbolt, Server Firestorm, Server Shadowbrook, Server Bluebird, Server Emberlight, Server Redwood, Server Silverhawk, Server Stormbreaker, Server Goldleaf, Server Thunderstrike and Server Glacier. \nTo ensure network security, we need to install monitoring devices (such as firewalls or intrusion detection systems) on some of these computers so that all communication links are monitored. \nAssume that the connections between the computers (i.e., the communication links) are bidirectional. This means that information can flow in both directions across any link. Our goal is to deploy monitoring devices in a way that ensures all communication links are covered by at least one monitoring device. \nProblem: How can we select the minimum number of computers to deploy monitoring devices, such that every communication link is monitored by at least one device? \nCommunication links as follows: : \nServer Blackwood is connected with Server Darkhorse, Server Ironclad, Server Emberfall, Server Skyhawk, Server Stormcloud, Server Shadowbrook, Server Bluebird, Server Silverhawk, Server Goldleaf. \nServer Twilight is connected with Server Sunflower, Server Seabreeze, Server Emberfall, Server Frostmoon, Server Skyhawk, Server Stormcloud, Server Thunderbolt, Server Firestorm, Server Emberlight, Server Redwood, Server Thunderstrike, Server Glacier. \nServer Nightshade is connected with Server Darkhorse, Server Frostmoon, Server Thunderbolt, Server Firestorm, Server Redwood, Server Silverhawk, Server Glacier. \nServer Sunflower is connected with Server Ironclad, Server Emberfall, Server Frostmoon, Server Skyhawk, Server Thunderbolt, Server Redwood, Server Silverhawk, Server Thunderstrike, Server Glacier. \nServer Darkhorse is connected with Server Seabreeze, Server Emberfall, Server Frostmoon, Server Skyhawk, Server Stormcloud, Server Thunderbolt, Server Glacier. \nServer Seabreeze is connected with Server Frostmoon, Server Skyhawk, Server Shadowbrook, Server Bluebird, Server Emberlight, Server Silverhawk, Server Goldleaf. \nServer Ironclad is connected with Server Bluebird, Server Emberlight, Server Redwood. \nServer Emberfall is connected with Server Frostmoon, Server Skyhawk, Server Stormcloud, Server Firestorm, Server Shadowbrook, Server Stormbreaker, Server Thunderstrike, Server Glacier. \nServer Frostmoon is connected with Server Shadowbrook, Server Silverhawk, Server Goldleaf, Server Thunderstrike. \nServer Skyhawk is connected with Server Bluebird, Server Redwood, Server Silverhawk, Server Stormbreaker, Server Goldleaf. \nServer Stormcloud is connected with Server Thunderbolt, Server Emberlight, Server Redwood, Server Silverhawk, Server Goldleaf, Server Thunderstrike, Server Glacier. \nServer Thunderbolt is connected with Server Shadowbrook, Server Emberlight, Server Silverhawk. \nServer Firestorm is connected with Server Bluebird. \nServer Shadowbrook is connected with Server Stormbreaker, Server Glacier. \nServer Bluebird is connected with Server Redwood, Server Stormbreaker, Server Thunderstrike. \nServer Emberlight is connected with Server Silverhawk, Server Stormbreaker, Server Thunderstrike. \nServer Redwood is connected with Server Thunderstrike. \nServer Silverhawk is connected with Server Thunderstrike, Server Glacier. \nServer Stormbreaker is connected with Server Goldleaf, Server Thunderstrike, Server Glacier. \n",

  "Q": "Our company has 22 computers connected by several communication links. These computers are named: Server Falconeye, Server Lighthouse, Server Twilight, Server Eaglecrest, Server Ravenstone, Server Firestorm, Server Starfire, Server Oceanview, Server Silverhawk, Server Windmill, Server Vortex, Server Windswept, Server Nightfall, Server Emberlight, Server Moonlight, Server Goldleaf, Server Solarflare, Server Glacier, Server Ironclad, Server Thunderbolt, Server Sandstorm and Server Emberfall. \nTo ensure network security, we need to install monitoring devices (such as firewalls or intrusion detection systems) on some of these computers so that all communication links are monitored. \nAssume that the connections between the computers (i.e., the communication links) are bidirectional. This means that information can flow in both directions across any link. Our goal is to deploy monitoring devices in a way that ensures all communication links are covered by at least one monitoring device. \nProblem: How can we select the minimum number of computers to deploy monitoring devices, such that every communication link is monitored by at least one device? \nCommunication links as follows: : \nServer Falconeye is connected with Server Eaglecrest, Server Ravenstone, Server Firestorm, Server Emberlight, Server Ironclad, Server Sandstorm, Server Emberfall. \nServer Lighthouse is connected with Server Eaglecrest, Server Starfire, Server Oceanview, Server Windmill, Server Vortex, Server Windswept, Server Moonlight, Server Goldleaf, Server Solarflare, Server Glacier, Server Ironclad, Server Thunderbolt. \nServer Twilight is connected with Server Eaglecrest, Server Firestorm, Server Oceanview, Server Windmill, Server Windswept, Server Goldleaf, Server Solarflare, Server Ironclad, Server Thunderbolt, Server Sandstorm. \nServer Eaglecrest is connected with Server Ravenstone, Server Firestorm, Server Starfire, Server Windswept, Server Emberlight, Server Thunderbolt, Server Sandstorm, Server Emberfall. \nServer Ravenstone is connected with Server Starfire, Server Oceanview, Server Solarflare, Server Ironclad, Server Thunderbolt, Server Sandstorm. \nServer Firestorm is connected with Server Starfire, Server Oceanview, Server Windmill, Server Vortex, Server Windswept, Server Moonlight, Server Glacier. \nServer Starfire is connected with Server Oceanview, Server Windmill, Server Vortex, Server Emberlight, Server Goldleaf, Server Glacier, Server Ironclad, Server Sandstorm, Server Emberfall. \nServer Oceanview is connected with Server Goldleaf, Server Sandstorm. \nServer Silverhawk is connected with Server Windswept, Server Thunderbolt. \nServer Windmill is connected with Server Vortex, Server Nightfall, Server Moonlight, Server Goldleaf, Server Glacier, Server Ironclad, Server Sandstorm. \nServer Vortex is connected with Server Windswept, Server Nightfall, Server Moonlight, Server Solarflare, Server Glacier, Server Ironclad. \nServer Windswept is connected with Server Goldleaf, Server Glacier, Server Thunderbolt. \nServer Nightfall is connected with Server Moonlight, Server Goldleaf. \nServer Emberlight is connected with Server Moonlight. \nServer Moonlight is connected with Server Solarflare, Server Glacier, Server Sandstorm, Server Emberfall. \nServer Goldleaf is connected with Server Thunderbolt, Server Sandstorm, Server Emberfall. \nServer Solarflare is connected with Server Glacier, Server Ironclad, Server Thunderbolt, Server Emberfall. \nServer Glacier is connected with Server Ironclad. \nServer Ironclad is connected with Server Emberfall. \nServer Thunderbolt is connected with Server Emberfall. \n",

  "Q": "Our company has 22 computers connected by several communication links. These computers are named: Server Glacier, Server Bluewave, Server Lighthouse, Server Bluebird, Server Sandstorm, Server Silverhawk, Server Willowbrook, Server Nightfall, Server Nightshade, Server Skyhawk, Server Tempest, Server Frostbite, Server Solarflare, Server Stealthwind, Server Seabreeze, Server Windswept, Server Emberfall, Server Redwood, Server Stormbreaker, Server Darkhorse, Server Shadowbrook and Server Brightstar. \nTo ensure network security, we need to install monitoring devices (such as firewalls or intrusion detection systems) on some of these computers so that all communication links are monitored. \nAssume that the connections between the computers (i.e., the communication links) are bidirectional. This means that information can flow in both directions across any link. Our goal is to deploy monitoring devices in a way that ensures all communication links are covered by at least one monitoring device. \nProblem: How can we select the minimum number of computers to deploy monitoring devices, such that every communication link is monitored by at least one device? \nCommunication links as follows: : \nServer Glacier is connected with Server Lighthouse, Server Sandstorm, Server Silverhawk, Server Willowbrook, Server Nightshade, Server Skyhawk, Server Tempest, Server Solarflare, Server Windswept, Server Emberfall, Server Stormbreaker, Server Shadowbrook. \nServer Bluewave is connected with Server Lighthouse, Server Bluebird, Server Sandstorm, Server Nightshade, Server Skyhawk, Server Tempest, Server Solarflare, Server Seabreeze, Server Redwood, Server Darkhorse, Server Brightstar. \nServer Lighthouse is connected with Server Sandstorm, Server Willowbrook, Server Nightfall, Server Tempest, Server Frostbite, Server Solarflare, Server Shadowbrook. \nServer Bluebird is connected with Server Sandstorm, Server Willowbrook, Server Nightfall, Server Nightshade, Server Tempest, Server Frostbite, Server Seabreeze, Server Redwood, Server Darkhorse. \nServer Sandstorm is connected with Server Silverhawk, Server Skyhawk, Server Seabreeze, Server Emberfall, Server Redwood, Server Stormbreaker, Server Darkhorse, Server Shadowbrook, Server Brightstar. \nServer Silverhawk is connected with Server Willowbrook, Server Skyhawk, Server Tempest, Server Solarflare, Server Seabreeze, Server Windswept, Server Shadowbrook. \nServer Willowbrook is connected with Server Nightshade, Server Tempest, Server Frostbite, Server Stealthwind, Server Windswept, Server Brightstar. \nServer Nightfall is connected with Server Nightshade, Server Solarflare, Server Stealthwind, Server Seabreeze, Server Emberfall. \nServer Nightshade is connected with Server Frostbite, Server Solarflare, Server Seabreeze, Server Emberfall, Server Darkhorse. \nServer Skyhawk is connected with Server Solarflare, Server Emberfall, Server Redwood, Server Shadowbrook, Server Brightstar. \nServer Tempest is connected with Server Stealthwind, Server Windswept, Server Emberfall, Server Stormbreaker. \nServer Frostbite is connected with Server Solarflare, Server Stealthwind, Server Seabreeze, Server Redwood. \nServer Solarflare is connected with Server Seabreeze, Server Emberfall. \nServer Stealthwind is connected with Server Seabreeze, Server Emberfall, Server Stormbreaker. \nServer Seabreeze is connected with Server Darkhorse, Server Shadowbrook, Server Brightstar. \nServer Windswept is connected with Server Stormbreaker. \nServer Emberfall is connected with Server Brightstar. \nServer Redwood is connected with Server Brightstar. \nServer Shadowbrook is connected with Server Brightstar. \n",

These computers are named: Server Glacier, Server Thunderbolt, Server Tempest, Server Bluewave, Server Moonlight, Server Silverstream, Server Emberlight, Server Amberwave, Server Glacierpeak, Server Stormbreaker, Server Oceanview, Server Ironclad, Server Skyhawk, Server Frostbite, Server Windswept, Server Bluebird, Server Ravenstone, Server Willowbrook, Server Nightshade, Server Vortex, Server Stormcloud and Server Goldleaf. \nTo ensure network security, we need to install monitoring devices (such as firewalls or intrusion detection systems) on some of these computers so that all communication links are monitored. \nAssume that the connections between the computers (i.e., the communication links) are bidirectional. This means that information can flow in both directions across any link. Our goal is to deploy monitoring devices in a way that ensures all communication links are covered by at least one monitoring device. \nProblem: How can we select the minimum number of computers to deploy monitoring devices, such that every communication link is monitored by at least one device? \nCommunication links as follows: : \nServer Glacier is connected with Server Thunderbolt, Server Bluewave, Server Stormbreaker, Server Frostbite, Server Windswept, Server Willowbrook, Server Stormcloud. \nServer Thunderbolt is connected with Server Bluewave, Server Silverstream, Server Stormbreaker, Server Oceanview, Server Ironclad, Server Frostbite, Server Bluebird, Server Ravenstone. \nServer Tempest is connected with Server Emberlight, Server Oceanview, Server Ironclad, Server Skyhawk, Server Windswept, Server Willowbrook, Server Vortex, Server Goldleaf. \nServer Bluewave is connected with Server Amberwave, Server Glacierpeak, Server Oceanview, Server Frostbite, Server Bluebird, Server Ravenstone, Server Nightshade, Server Goldleaf. \nServer Moonlight is connected with Server Emberlight, Server Oceanview, Server Nightshade, Server Stormcloud. \nServer Silverstream is connected with Server Emberlight, Server Stormbreaker, Server Ironclad, Server Skyhawk, Server Frostbite, Server Windswept, Server Nightshade. \nServer Emberlight is connected with Server Amberwave, Server Frostbite, Server Windswept, Server Ravenstone, Server Willowbrook, Server Nightshade, Server Vortex, Server Stormcloud, Server Goldleaf. \nServer Amberwave is connected with Server Glacierpeak, Server Stormbreaker, Server Ironclad, Server Skyhawk, Server Vortex. \nServer Glacierpeak is connected with Server Stormbreaker, Server Bluebird, Server Ravenstone, Server Willowbrook, Server Nightshade. \nServer Stormbreaker is connected with Server Oceanview, Server Ironclad, Server Frostbite, Server Ravenstone, Server Willowbrook, Server Nightshade, Server Vortex. \nServer Oceanview is connected with Server Frostbite, Server Ravenstone, Server Willowbrook, Server Nightshade, Server Goldleaf. \nServer Ironclad is connected with Server Frostbite, Server Windswept, Server Bluebird, Server Ravenstone, Server Goldleaf. \nServer Skyhawk is connected with Server Bluebird, Server Ravenstone, Server Nightshade, Server Stormcloud. \nServer Frostbite is connected with Server Willowbrook, Server Stormcloud, Server Goldleaf. \nServer Windswept is connected with Server Bluebird, Server Ravenstone, Server Willowbrook. \nServer Bluebird is connected with Server Willowbrook. \nServer Ravenstone is connected with Server Willowbrook, Server Vortex, Server Stormcloud. \nServer Willowbrook is connected with Server Vortex, Server Goldleaf. \nServer Nightshade is connected with Server Stormcloud. \nServer Stormcloud is connected with Server Goldleaf. \n",

  "Q": "Our company has 22 computers connected by several communication links. These computers are named: Server Eaglecrest, Server Amberwave, Server Ironbark, Server Frostmoon, Server Skyhawk, Server Vortex, Server Redwood, Server Ghostwind, Server Glacier, Server Goldleaf, Server Silverstream, Server Seabreeze, Server Starfire, Server Stormcloud, Server Windmill, Server Silverstone, Server Sunflower, Server Tempest, Server Blackwood, Server Ironclad, Server Emberlight and Server Brightstar. \nTo ensure network security, we need to install monitoring devices (such as firewalls or intrusion detection systems) on some of these computers so that all communication links are monitored. \nAssume that the connections between the computers (i.e., the communication links) are bidirectional. This means that information can flow in both directions across any link. Our goal is to deploy monitoring devices in a way that ensures all communication links are covered by at least one monitoring device. \nProblem: How can we select the minimum number of computers to deploy monitoring devices, such that every communication link is monitored by at least one device? \nCommunication links as follows: : \nServer Eaglecrest is connected with Server Amberwave, Server Skyhawk, Server Ghostwind, Server Silverstream, Server Stormcloud, Server Silverstone, Server Blackwood, Server Emberlight, Server Brightstar. \nServer Amberwave is connected with Server Skyhawk, Server Glacier, Server Goldleaf, Server Silverstream, Server Starfire, Server Sunflower, Server Ironclad, Server Emberlight, Server Brightstar. \nServer Ironbark is connected with Server Redwood, Server Ghostwind, Server Glacier, Server Goldleaf, Server Seabreeze, Server Stormcloud, Server Sunflower, Server Brightstar. \nServer Frostmoon is connected with Server Vortex, Server Redwood, Server Ghostwind, Server Glacier, Server Goldleaf, Server Starfire, Server Silverstone, Server Sunflower, Server Tempest, Server Ironclad. \nServer Skyhawk is connected with Server Vortex, Server Glacier, Server Starfire, Server Windmill, Server Silverstone, Server Tempest, Server Emberlight, Server Brightstar. \nServer Vortex is connected with Server Redwood, Server Ghostwind, Server Goldleaf, Server Seabreeze, Server Starfire, Server Stormcloud, Server Sunflower, Server Brightstar. \nServer Redwood is connected with Server Glacier, Server Goldleaf, Server Stormcloud, Server Windmill, Server Brightstar. \nServer Ghostwind is connected with Server Starfire, Server Stormcloud, Server Windmill, Server Tempest, Server Blackwood, Server Brightstar. \nServer Glacier is connected with Server Silverstream, Server Seabreeze, Server Starfire, Server Stormcloud, Server Windmill, Server Sunflower, Server Blackwood, Server Emberlight. \nServer Goldleaf is connected with Server Silverstream, Server Stormcloud, Server Silverstone, Server Tempest, Server Blackwood. \nServer Silverstream is connected with Server Seabreeze, Server Starfire, Server Silverstone, Server Brightstar. \nServer Seabreeze is connected with Server Starfire, Server Stormcloud, Server Tempest, Server Ironclad, Server Emberlight. \nServer Starfire is connected with Server Stormcloud, Server Silverstone, Server Tempest, Server Blackwood. \nServer Stormcloud is connected with Server Silverstone, Server Tempest, Server Blackwood, Server Ironclad. \nServer Tempest is connected with Server Ironclad. \nServer Blackwood is connected with Server Emberlight. \nServer Ironclad is connected with Server Brightstar. \n",

  "Q": "Our company has 22 computers connected by several communication links. These computers are named: Server Glacierpeak, Server Twilight, Server Falconeye, Server Silverhawk, Server Stormcloud, Server Glacier, Server Bluewave, Server Stormbreaker, Server Lighthouse, Server Thunderbolt, Server Starfire, Server Vortex, Server Frostmoon, Server Goldleaf, Server Ghostwind, Server Tempest, Server Firestorm, Server Oceanview, Server Thunderstrike, Server Crimsoncloud, Server Windmill and Server Sandstorm. \nTo ensure network security, we need to install monitoring devices (such as firewalls or intrusion detection systems) on some of these computers so that all communication links are monitored. \nAssume that the connections between the computers (i.e., the communication links) are bidirectional. This means that information can flow in both directions across any link. Our goal is to deploy monitoring devices in a way that ensures all communication links are covered by at least one monitoring device. \nProblem: How can we select the minimum number of computers to deploy monitoring devices, such that every communication link is monitored by at least one device? \nCommunication links as follows: : \nServer Glacierpeak is connected with Server Twilight, Server Falconeye, Server Lighthouse, Server Starfire, Server Vortex, Server Goldleaf, Server Tempest, Server Firestorm, Server Thunderstrike, Server Sandstorm. \nServer Twilight is connected with Server Stormcloud, Server Glacier, Server Bluewave, Server Lighthouse, Server Thunderbolt, Server Starfire, Server Vortex. \nServer Falconeye is connected with Server Stormcloud, Server Glacier, Server Bluewave, Server Stormbreaker, Server Lighthouse, Server Thunderbolt, Server Starfire, Server Goldleaf, Server Oceanview, Server Windmill. \nServer Silverhawk is connected with Server Bluewave, Server Stormbreaker, Server Frostmoon, Server Goldleaf, Server Tempest, Server Firestorm. \nServer Stormcloud is connected with Server Bluewave, Server Stormbreaker, Server Lighthouse, Server Frostmoon, Server Goldleaf, Server Ghostwind, Server Oceanview, Server Sandstorm. \nServer Glacier is connected with Server Bluewave, Server Thunderbolt, Server Starfire, Server Vortex, Server Frostmoon, Server Goldleaf, Server Tempest, Server Oceanview, Server Thunderstrike, Server Crimsoncloud. \nServer Bluewave is connected with Server Stormbreaker, Server Starfire, Server Vortex, Server Tempest, Server Firestorm, Server Thunderstrike, Server Sandstorm. \nServer Stormbreaker is connected with Server Vortex, Server Frostmoon, Server Goldleaf, Server Ghostwind, Server Oceanview, Server Windmill, Server Sandstorm. \nServer Lighthouse is connected with Server Starfire, Server Vortex, Server Frostmoon, Server Oceanview, Server Thunderstrike, Server Crimsoncloud, Server Windmill, Server Sandstorm. \nServer Thunderbolt is connected with Server Frostmoon, Server Tempest, Server Crimsoncloud, Server Sandstorm. \nServer Starfire is connected with Server Tempest, Server Oceanview, Server Thunderstrike, Server Crimsoncloud, Server Windmill. \nServer Vortex is connected with Server Goldleaf. \nServer Frostmoon is connected with Server Tempest, Server Oceanview, Server Windmill. \nServer Goldleaf is connected with Server Ghostwind, Server Windmill, Server Sandstorm. \nServer Ghostwind is connected with Server Oceanview. \nServer Tempest is connected with Server Thunderstrike, Server Crimsoncloud, Server Windmill. \nServer Firestorm is connected with Server Oceanview. \nServer Oceanview is connected with Server Thunderstrike, Server Windmill. \n",

  "Q": "Our company has 22 computers connected by several communication links. These computers are named: Server Starfire, Server Ravenstone, Server Windswept, Server Shadowbrook, Server Lighthouse, Server Ironbark, Server Emberfall, Server Sunflower, Server Eaglecrest, Server Darkhorse, Server Thunderbolt, Server Nightfall, Server Frostbite, Server Silverhawk, Server Stormbreaker, Server Silverstream, Server Falconeye, Server Glacierpeak, Server Glacier, Server Windmill, Server Solarflare and Server Twilight. \nTo ensure network security, we need to install monitoring devices (such as firewalls or intrusion detection systems) on some of these computers so that all communication links are monitored. \nAssume that the connections between the computers (i.e., the communication links) are bidirectional. This means that information can flow in both directions across any link. Our goal is to deploy monitoring devices in a way that ensures all communication links are covered by at least one monitoring device. \nProblem: How can we select the minimum number of computers to deploy monitoring devices, such that every communication link is monitored by at least one device? \nCommunication links as follows: : \nServer Starfire is connected with Server Ravenstone, Server Lighthouse, Server Sunflower, Server Eaglecrest, Server Darkhorse, Server Frostbite, Server Falconeye, Server Glacierpeak, Server Twilight. \nServer Ravenstone is connected with Server Windswept, Server Shadowbrook, Server Lighthouse, Server Ironbark, Server Darkhorse, Server Nightfall, Server Silverhawk, Server Silverstream. \nServer Windswept is connected with Server Shadowbrook, Server Lighthouse, Server Sunflower, Server Nightfall, Server Frostbite, Server Stormbreaker, Server Falconeye, Server Glacier, Server Windmill, Server Solarflare. \nServer Shadowbrook is connected with Server Lighthouse, Server Thunderbolt, Server Silverhawk, Server Falconeye. \nServer Lighthouse is connected with Server Sunflower, Server Thunderbolt, Server Silverhawk, Server Stormbreaker, Server Falconeye, Server Glacier, Server Solarflare, Server Twilight. \nServer Ironbark is connected with Server Darkhorse, Server Thunderbolt, Server Frostbite, Server Silverhawk, Server Silverstream, Server Windmill, Server Solarflare. \nServer Emberfall is connected with Server Eaglecrest, Server Darkhorse, Server Thunderbolt, Server Nightfall, Server Frostbite, Server Stormbreaker, Server Silverstream, Server Glacierpeak, Server Glacier, Server Windmill. \nServer Sunflower is connected with Server Thunderbolt, Server Stormbreaker, Server Falconeye, Server Glacierpeak, Server Windmill. \nServer Eaglecrest is connected with Server Darkhorse, Server Thunderbolt, Server Nightfall, Server Falconeye, Server Glacierpeak, Server Glacier, Server Solarflare. \nServer Darkhorse is connected with Server Nightfall, Server Silverstream, Server Glacierpeak, Server Windmill. \nServer Thunderbolt is connected with Server Frostbite, Server Silverhawk, Server Silverstream, Server Falconeye, Server Glacier, Server Twilight. \nServer Nightfall is connected with Server Frostbite, Server Falconeye, Server Glacierpeak. \nServer Frostbite is connected with Server Falconeye, Server Glacierpeak, Server Glacier, Server Twilight. \nServer Silverhawk is connected with Server Windmill. \nServer Stormbreaker is connected with Server Falconeye, Server Windmill. \nServer Silverstream is connected with Server Glacier. \nServer Falconeye is connected with Server Glacierpeak, Server Windmill, Server Solarflare, Server Twilight. \nServer Glacierpeak is connected with Server Glacier, Server Windmill. \nServer Glacier is connected with Server Windmill. \n",

  "Q": "Our company has 22 computers connected by several communication links. These computers are named: Server Ghostwind, Server Thunderstrike, Server Emberfall, Server Amberwave, Server Brightstar, Server Firestorm, Server Redwood, Server Falconeye, Server Starfire, Server Windmill, Server Frostbite, Server Stormbreaker, Server Vortex, Server Seabreeze, Server Goldleaf, Server Skyhawk, Server Glacier, Server Stealthwind, Server Solarflare, Server Nightfall, Server Ironbark and Server Bluewave. \nTo ensure network security, we need to install monitoring devices (such as firewalls or intrusion detection systems) on some of these computers so that all communication links are monitored. \nAssume that the connections between the computers (i.e., the communication links) are bidirectional. This means that information can flow in both directions across any link. Our goal is to deploy monitoring devices in a way that ensures all communication links are covered by at least one monitoring device. \nProblem: How can we select the minimum number of computers to deploy monitoring devices, such that every communication link is monitored by at least one device? \nCommunication links as follows: : \nServer Ghostwind is connected with Server Amberwave, Server Brightstar, Server Firestorm, Server Falconeye, Server Windmill, Server Vortex, Server Skyhawk, Server Solarflare, Server Nightfall, Server Ironbark, Server Bluewave. \nServer Thunderstrike is connected with Server Emberfall, Server Firestorm, Server Redwood, Server Falconeye, Server Starfire, Server Frostbite, Server Vortex, Server Skyhawk, Server Stealthwind, Server Solarflare. \nServer Emberfall is connected with Server Amberwave, Server Redwood, Server Falconeye, Server Starfire, Server Stormbreaker, Server Vortex, Server Seabreeze, Server Goldleaf, Server Skyhawk, Server Stealthwind, Server Solarflare, Server Nightfall. \nServer Amberwave is connected with Server Seabreeze, Server Goldleaf, Server Glacier, Server Solarflare, Server Ironbark. \nServer Brightstar is connected with Server Redwood, Server Stormbreaker, Server Seabreeze, Server Skyhawk, Server Glacier, Server Stealthwind. \nServer Firestorm is connected with Server Stormbreaker, Server Glacier, Server Stealthwind, Server Ironbark, Server Bluewave. \nServer Redwood is connected with Server Falconeye, Server Starfire, Server Frostbite, Server Stormbreaker, Server Vortex, Server Glacier, Server Stealthwind, Server Solarflare, Server Nightfall. \nServer Falconeye is connected with Server Vortex, Server Goldleaf, Server Skyhawk, Server Glacier, Server Solarflare. \nServer Starfire is connected with Server Windmill, Server Stormbreaker, Server Seabreeze, Server Skyhawk, Server Solarflare, Server Nightfall, Server Bluewave. \nServer Windmill is connected with Server Frostbite, Server Stormbreaker, Server Goldleaf, Server Skyhawk, Server Solarflare. \nServer Frostbite is connected with Server Stealthwind. \nServer Stormbreaker is connected with Server Goldleaf, Server Skyhawk, Server Bluewave. \nServer Vortex is connected with Server Seabreeze, Server Goldleaf, Server Bluewave. \nServer Seabreeze is connected with Server Skyhawk, Server Glacier, Server Nightfall, Server Ironbark, Server Bluewave. \nServer Goldleaf is connected with Server Skyhawk, Server Stealthwind, Server Bluewave. \nServer Skyhawk is connected with Server Glacier, Server Bluewave. \nServer Glacier is connected with Server Stealthwind, Server Solarflare. \nServer Stealthwind is connected with Server Bluewave. \nServer Solarflare is connected with Server Nightfall. \n",

  "Q": "Our company has 22 computers connected by several communication links. These computers are named: Server Emberfall, Server Silverhawk, Server Sandstorm, Server Solarflare, Server Thunderbolt, Server Sunflower, Server Stealthwind, Server Stormbreaker, Server Bluewave, Server Glacierpeak, Server Willowbrook, Server Ghostwind, Server Crimsoncloud, Server Seabreeze, Server Starfire, Server Blackwood, Server Emberlight, Server Ironbark, Server Lighthouse, Server Firefly, Server Skyhawk and Server Thunderstrike. \nTo ensure network security, we need to install monitoring devices (such as firewalls or intrusion detection systems) on some of these computers so that all communication links are monitored. \nAssume that the connections between the computers (i.e., the communication links) are bidirectional. This means that information can flow in both directions across any link. Our goal is to deploy monitoring devices in a way that ensures all communication links are covered by at least one monitoring device. \nProblem: How can we select the minimum number of computers to deploy monitoring devices, such that every communication link is monitored by at least one device? \nCommunication links as follows: : \nServer Emberfall is connected with Server Sandstorm, Server Sunflower, Server Stormbreaker, Server Willowbrook, Server Seabreeze, Server Ironbark, Server Skyhawk. \nServer Silverhawk is connected with Server Sandstorm, Server Solarflare, Server Thunderbolt, Server Glacierpeak, Server Willowbrook, Server Ghostwind, Server Seabreeze, Server Starfire, Server Blackwood, Server Emberlight, Server Lighthouse, Server Skyhawk. \nServer Sandstorm is connected with Server Solarflare, Server Thunderbolt, Server Stealthwind, Server Glacierpeak, Server Crimsoncloud, Server Starfire, Server Blackwood, Server Emberlight. \nServer Solarflare is connected with Server Thunderbolt, Server Sunflower, Server Stormbreaker, Server Ghostwind, Server Seabreeze, Server Ironbark, Server Lighthouse, Server Thunderstrike. \nServer Thunderbolt is connected with Server Stealthwind, Server Bluewave, Server Ghostwind, Server Crimsoncloud, Server Emberlight, Server Ironbark, Server Lighthouse, Server Firefly, Server Skyhawk, Server Thunderstrike. \nServer Sunflower is connected with Server Stealthwind, Server Glacierpeak, Server Willowbrook, Server Lighthouse. \nServer Stealthwind is connected with Server Glacierpeak, Server Ghostwind, Server Emberlight, Server Skyhawk, Server Thunderstrike. \nServer Stormbreaker is connected with Server Willowbrook, Server Ghostwind, Server Seabreeze, Server Emberlight, Server Ironbark, Server Firefly, Server Skyhawk. \nServer Bluewave is connected with Server Crimsoncloud, Server Lighthouse, Server Thunderstrike. \nServer Glacierpeak is connected with Server Crimsoncloud, Server Firefly, Server Skyhawk. \nServer Willowbrook is connected with Server Blackwood, Server Ironbark, Server Lighthouse. \nServer Ghostwind is connected with Server Blackwood, Server Emberlight, Server Ironbark, Server Lighthouse. \nServer Crimsoncloud is connected with Server Seabreeze, Server Starfire, Server Blackwood, Server Lighthouse, Server Firefly, Server Thunderstrike. \nServer Seabreeze is connected with Server Blackwood, Server Lighthouse, Server Skyhawk, Server Thunderstrike. \nServer Starfire is connected with Server Blackwood, Server Emberlight, Server Ironbark, Server Firefly, Server Skyhawk. \nServer Blackwood is connected with Server Lighthouse. \nServer Emberlight is connected with Server Lighthouse, Server Firefly. \nServer Ironbark is connected with Server Lighthouse, Server Firefly. \nServer Lighthouse is connected with Server Skyhawk, Server Thunderstrike. \n",

  "Q": "Our company has 22 computers connected by several communication links. These computers are named: Server Redwood, Server Ghostwind, Server Skyhawk, Server Falconeye, Server Glacier, Server Mirage, Server Sandstorm, Server Ravenstone, Server Nightshade, Server Oceanview, Server Emberfall, Server Sunflower, Server Ironclad, Server Bluewave, Server Stormcloud, Server Vortex, Server Bluebird, Server Starfire, Server Thunderbolt, Server Windswept, Server Brightstar and Server Silverhawk. \nTo ensure network security, we need to install monitoring devices (such as firewalls or intrusion detection systems) on some of these computers so that all communication links are monitored. \nAssume that the connections between the computers (i.e., the communication links) are bidirectional. This means that information can flow in both directions across any link. Our goal is to deploy monitoring devices in a way that ensures all communication links are covered by at least one monitoring device. \nProblem: How can we select the minimum number of computers to deploy monitoring devices, such that every communication link is monitored by at least one device? \nCommunication links as follows: : \nServer Redwood is connected with Server Ghostwind, Server Skyhawk, Server Falconeye, Server Glacier, Server Oceanview, Server Sunflower, Server Bluewave, Server Stormcloud, Server Starfire, Server Brightstar, Server Silverhawk. \nServer Ghostwind is connected with Server Glacier, Server Mirage, Server Sandstorm, Server Ravenstone, Server Nightshade, Server Emberfall, Server Ironclad, Server Stormcloud, Server Vortex, Server Bluebird, Server Starfire, Server Silverhawk. \nServer Skyhawk is connected with Server Falconeye, Server Emberfall, Server Sunflower, Server Bluewave, Server Stormcloud, Server Vortex, Server Windswept. \nServer Falconeye is connected with Server Emberfall, Server Sunflower, Server Bluewave, Server Stormcloud, Server Vortex, Server Bluebird, Server Starfire, Server Thunderbolt. \nServer Glacier is connected with Server Emberfall, Server Thunderbolt, Server Brightstar. \nServer Mirage is connected with Server Sandstorm, Server Ravenstone, Server Emberfall, Server Sunflower, Server Bluewave, Server Stormcloud, Server Vortex, Server Starfire. \nServer Sandstorm is connected with Server Ravenstone, Server Nightshade, Server Oceanview, Server Ironclad, Server Bluebird, Server Thunderbolt, Server Windswept, Server Silverhawk. \nServer Ravenstone is connected with Server Nightshade, Server Oceanview, Server Sunflower, Server Ironclad, Server Silverhawk. \nServer Nightshade is connected with Server Emberfall, Server Stormcloud, Server Vortex, Server Bluebird, Server Starfire, Server Thunderbolt, Server Brightstar, Server Silverhawk. \nServer Oceanview is connected with Server Emberfall, Server Stormcloud, Server Silverhawk. \nServer Emberfall is connected with Server Ironclad, Server Bluewave, Server Bluebird, Server Thunderbolt, Server Brightstar. \nServer Sunflower is connected with Server Ironclad, Server Stormcloud, Server Brightstar. \nServer Ironclad is connected with Server Vortex, Server Bluebird, Server Starfire, Server Silverhawk. \nServer Bluewave is connected with Server Vortex, Server Windswept, Server Brightstar. \nServer Stormcloud is connected with Server Starfire, Server Brightstar. \nServer Vortex is connected with Server Starfire. \nServer Bluebird is connected with Server Thunderbolt, Server Windswept. \nServer Thunderbolt is connected with Server Brightstar, Server Silverhawk. \nServer Brightstar is connected with Server Silverhawk. \n",

  "Q": "Our company has 22 computers connected by several communication links. These computers are named: Server Windswept, Server Solarflare, Server Frostbite, Server Stealthwind, Server Oceanview, Server Frostmoon, Server Brightstar, Server Falconeye, Server Starfire, Server Silverhawk, Server Lighthouse, Server Moonlight, Server Ironclad, Server Glacier, Server Blackwood, Server Nightshade, Server Ghostwind, Server Skyhawk, Server Tempest, Server Stormcloud, Server Bluewave and Server Sunflower. \nTo ensure network security, we need to install monitoring devices (such as firewalls or intrusion detection systems) on some of these computers so that all communication links are monitored. \nAssume that the connections between the computers (i.e., the communication links) are bidirectional. This means that information can flow in both directions across any link. Our goal is to deploy monitoring devices in a way that ensures all communication links are covered by at least one monitoring device. \nProblem: How can we select the minimum number of computers to deploy monitoring devices, such that every communication link is monitored by at least one device? \nCommunication links as follows: : \nServer Windswept is connected with Server Stealthwind, Server Brightstar, Server Falconeye, Server Starfire, Server Silverhawk, Server Lighthouse, Server Moonlight, Server Ironclad. \nServer Solarflare is connected with Server Stealthwind, Server Oceanview, Server Falconeye, Server Ironclad, Server Glacier, Server Blackwood, Server Tempest, Server Sunflower. \nServer Frostbite is connected with Server Stealthwind, Server Falconeye, Server Starfire, Server Silverhawk, Server Moonlight, Server Blackwood, Server Nightshade, Server Skyhawk, Server Tempest, Server Stormcloud, Server Sunflower. \nServer Stealthwind is connected with Server Oceanview, Server Glacier, Server Skyhawk, Server Stormcloud, Server Bluewave. \nServer Oceanview is connected with Server Frostmoon, Server Glacier, Server Ghostwind, Server Tempest, Server Stormcloud, Server Sunflower. \nServer Frostmoon is connected with Server Starfire, Server Ghostwind, Server Skyhawk, Server Tempest, Server Stormcloud. \nServer Brightstar is connected with Server Silverhawk, Server Lighthouse, Server Moonlight, Server Ironclad, Server Blackwood, Server Stormcloud. \nServer Falconeye is connected with Server Lighthouse, Server Ironclad, Server Ghostwind, Server Stormcloud, Server Bluewave, Server Sunflower. \nServer Starfire is connected with Server Silverhawk, Server Moonlight, Server Glacier, Server Nightshade, Server Tempest, Server Sunflower. \nServer Silverhawk is connected with Server Ironclad, Server Tempest, Server Bluewave. \nServer Lighthouse is connected with Server Moonlight, Server Ironclad, Server Nightshade, Server Ghostwind, Server Tempest. \nServer Moonlight is connected with Server Blackwood, Server Skyhawk, Server Tempest, Server Bluewave, Server Sunflower. \nServer Ironclad is connected with Server Glacier, Server Blackwood, Server Ghostwind, Server Skyhawk, Server Stormcloud. \nServer Glacier is connected with Server Ghostwind, Server Tempest, Server Stormcloud. \nServer Blackwood is connected with Server Skyhawk, Server Tempest, Server Stormcloud, Server Bluewave. \nServer Nightshade is connected with Server Ghostwind, Server Tempest, Server Bluewave. \nServer Ghostwind is connected with Server Tempest, Server Bluewave, Server Sunflower. \nServer Skyhawk is connected with Server Tempest, Server Bluewave. \nServer Tempest is connected with Server Stormcloud, Server Sunflower. \n",

  "Q": "Our company has 22 computers connected by several communication links. These computers are named: Server Ironbark, Server Thunderstrike, Server Nightshade, Server Emberfall, Server Tempest, Server Firestorm, Server Amberwave, Server Glacierpeak, Server Redwood, Server Eaglecrest, Server Windswept, Server Darkhorse, Server Goldleaf, Server Nightfall, Server Silverstone, Server Crimsoncloud, Server Moonlight, Server Starfire, Server Thunderbolt, Server Silverstream, Server Ghostwind and Server Stormbreaker. \nTo ensure network security, we need to install monitoring devices (such as firewalls or intrusion detection systems) on some of these computers so that all communication links are monitored. \nAssume that the connections between the computers (i.e., the communication links) are bidirectional. This means that information can flow in both directions across any link. Our goal is to deploy monitoring devices in a way that ensures all communication links are covered by at least one monitoring device. \nProblem: How can we select the minimum number of computers to deploy monitoring devices, such that every communication link is monitored by at least one device? \nCommunication links as follows: : \nServer Ironbark is connected with Server Thunderstrike, Server Emberfall, Server Tempest, Server Amberwave, Server Eaglecrest, Server Nightfall, Server Crimsoncloud, Server Thunderbolt, Server Silverstream. \nServer Thunderstrike is connected with Server Nightshade, Server Emberfall, Server Tempest, Server Glacierpeak, Server Eaglecrest, Server Windswept, Server Darkhorse, Server Goldleaf, Server Thunderbolt, Server Ghostwind, Server Stormbreaker. \nServer Nightshade is connected with Server Emberfall, Server Firestorm, Server Amberwave, Server Glacierpeak, Server Redwood, Server Windswept, Server Starfire, Server Stormbreaker. \nServer Emberfall is connected with Server Firestorm, Server Amberwave, Server Glacierpeak, Server Eaglecrest, Server Darkhorse, Server Nightfall, Server Moonlight, Server Starfire, Server Silverstream, Server Ghostwind. \nServer Tempest is connected with Server Firestorm, Server Redwood, Server Windswept, Server Darkhorse, Server Goldleaf, Server Nightfall, Server Silverstone, Server Moonlight, Server Starfire, Server Silverstream, Server Ghostwind. \nServer Firestorm is connected with Server Eaglecrest, Server Windswept, Server Nightfall, Server Starfire, Server Stormbreaker. \nServer Amberwave is connected with Server Glacierpeak, Server Crimsoncloud, Server Thunderbolt. \nServer Glacierpeak is connected with Server Eaglecrest, Server Darkhorse, Server Starfire. \nServer Redwood is connected with Server Darkhorse, Server Goldleaf, Server Nightfall, Server Silverstone, Server Moonlight, Server Starfire, Server Ghostwind. \nServer Eaglecrest is connected with Server Crimsoncloud, Server Starfire, Server Ghostwind, Server Stormbreaker. \nServer Windswept is connected with Server Darkhorse, Server Silverstone, Server Crimsoncloud, Server Moonlight, Server Starfire, Server Ghostwind. \nServer Darkhorse is connected with Server Goldleaf, Server Moonlight. \nServer Goldleaf is connected with Server Nightfall, Server Starfire, Server Silverstream, Server Ghostwind. \nServer Nightfall is connected with Server Crimsoncloud, Server Silverstream, Server Stormbreaker. \nServer Silverstone is connected with Server Moonlight, Server Starfire, Server Ghostwind. \nServer Crimsoncloud is connected with Server Moonlight. \nServer Moonlight is connected with Server Silverstream. \nServer Starfire is connected with Server Thunderbolt, Server Silverstream, Server Ghostwind, Server Stormbreaker. \nServer Thunderbolt is connected with Server Stormbreaker. \n",

  "Q": "Our company has 22 computers connected by several communication links. These computers are named: Server Willowbrook, Server Lighthouse, Server Oceanview, Server Tempest, Server Brightstar, Server Glacierpeak, Server Nightfall, Server Emberfall, Server Crimsoncloud, Server Stormcloud, Server Thunderstrike, Server Nightshade, Server Twilight, Server Ironbark, Server Mirage, Server Frostmoon, Server Silverstone, Server Ironclad, Server Glacier, Server Sunflower, Server Windswept and Server Blackwood. \nTo ensure network security, we need to install monitoring devices (such as firewalls or intrusion detection systems) on some of these computers so that all communication links are monitored. \nAssume that the connections between the computers (i.e., the communication links) are bidirectional. This means that information can flow in both directions across any link. Our goal is to deploy monitoring devices in a way that ensures all communication links are covered by at least one monitoring device. \nProblem: How can we select the minimum number of computers to deploy monitoring devices, such that every communication link is monitored by at least one device? \nCommunication links as follows: : \nServer Willowbrook is connected with Server Oceanview, Server Brightstar, Server Emberfall, Server Stormcloud, Server Nightshade, Server Twilight, Server Ironbark, Server Frostmoon, Server Silverstone, Server Ironclad, Server Glacier. \nServer Lighthouse is connected with Server Oceanview, Server Tempest, Server Emberfall, Server Stormcloud, Server Nightshade, Server Frostmoon, Server Ironclad, Server Sunflower, Server Windswept, Server Blackwood. \nServer Oceanview is connected with Server Tempest, Server Nightshade, Server Twilight, Server Mirage, Server Silverstone, Server Windswept. \nServer Tempest is connected with Server Stormcloud, Server Thunderstrike, Server Twilight, Server Mirage, Server Silverstone, Server Ironclad, Server Sunflower. \nServer Brightstar is connected with Server Glacierpeak, Server Stormcloud, Server Ironclad, Server Glacier. \nServer Glacierpeak is connected with Server Crimsoncloud, Server Nightshade, Server Frostmoon, Server Ironclad, Server Glacier, Server Sunflower. \nServer Nightfall is connected with Server Emberfall, Server Crimsoncloud, Server Twilight, Server Mirage, Server Sunflower, Server Windswept. \nServer Emberfall is connected with Server Crimsoncloud, Server Stormcloud, Server Sunflower. \nServer Crimsoncloud is connected with Server Thunderstrike, Server Mirage, Server Frostmoon, Server Ironclad, Server Glacier, Server Sunflower. \nServer Stormcloud is connected with Server Thunderstrike, Server Ironbark, Server Mirage, Server Ironclad, Server Sunflower, Server Blackwood. \nServer Thunderstrike is connected with Server Mirage, Server Frostmoon, Server Silverstone, Server Glacier, Server Sunflower, Server Windswept. \nServer Nightshade is connected with Server Twilight, Server Frostmoon, Server Silverstone, Server Glacier, Server Sunflower, Server Blackwood. \nServer Twilight is connected with Server Mirage, Server Blackwood. \nServer Ironbark is connected with Server Ironclad, Server Sunflower, Server Windswept. \nServer Mirage is connected with Server Frostmoon, Server Ironclad, Server Glacier, Server Windswept, Server Blackwood. \nServer Frostmoon is connected with Server Silverstone, Server Glacier, Server Sunflower, Server Windswept. \nServer Silverstone is connected with Server Glacier. \nServer Ironclad is connected with Server Glacier. \nServer Sunflower is connected with Server Windswept, Server Blackwood. \nServer Windswept is connected with Server Blackwood. \n",

  "Q": "Our company has 22 computers connected by several communication links. These computers are named: Server Stormbreaker, Server Moonlight, Server Silverhawk, Server Thunderbolt, Server Bluewave, Server Windswept, Server Redwood, Server Windmill, Server Ironclad, Server Emberlight, Server Lighthouse, Server Twilight, Server Silverstream, Server Glacier, Server Eaglecrest, Server Willowbrook, Server Bluebird, Server Ironbark, Server Amberwave, Server Ghostwind, Server Vortex and Server Glacierpeak. \nTo ensure network security, we need to install monitoring devices (such as firewalls or intrusion detection systems) on some of these computers so that all communication links are monitored. \nAssume that the connections between the computers (i.e., the communication links) are bidirectional. This means that information can flow in both directions across any link. Our goal is to deploy monitoring devices in a way that ensures all communication links are covered by at least one monitoring device. \nProblem: How can we select the minimum number of computers to deploy monitoring devices, such that every communication link is monitored by at least one device? \nCommunication links as follows: : \nServer Stormbreaker is connected with Server Moonlight, Server Silverhawk, Server Lighthouse, Server Silverstream, Server Glacier, Server Bluebird, Server Ghostwind, Server Glacierpeak. \nServer Moonlight is connected with Server Redwood, Server Windmill, Server Ironclad, Server Lighthouse, Server Glacier, Server Eaglecrest, Server Bluebird, Server Amberwave, Server Ghostwind, Server Vortex. \nServer Silverhawk is connected with Server Thunderbolt, Server Bluewave, Server Glacier, Server Eaglecrest, Server Willowbrook, Server Bluebird, Server Ironbark, Server Amberwave, Server Ghostwind. \nServer Thunderbolt is connected with Server Windswept, Server Lighthouse, Server Silverstream, Server Eaglecrest, Server Willowbrook, Server Ironbark, Server Ghostwind, Server Vortex. \nServer Bluewave is connected with Server Windswept, Server Windmill, Server Ironclad, Server Lighthouse, Server Willowbrook, Server Bluebird, Server Ironbark, Server Glacierpeak. \nServer Windswept is connected with Server Lighthouse, Server Eaglecrest. \nServer Redwood is connected with Server Windmill, Server Lighthouse, Server Twilight, Server Silverstream, Server Willowbrook, Server Amberwave, Server Vortex, Server Glacierpeak. \nServer Windmill is connected with Server Lighthouse, Server Silverstream, Server Glacier, Server Amberwave, Server Ghostwind, Server Vortex. \nServer Ironclad is connected with Server Lighthouse, Server Silverstream, Server Willowbrook, Server Vortex. \nServer Emberlight is connected with Server Twilight, Server Silverstream, Server Glacier, Server Willowbrook, Server Bluebird, Server Amberwave. \nServer Lighthouse is connected with Server Silverstream, Server Eaglecrest, Server Bluebird, Server Glacierpeak. \nServer Twilight is connected with Server Silverstream, Server Glacier, Server Willowbrook, Server Amberwave, Server Glacierpeak. \nServer Silverstream is connected with Server Willowbrook, Server Ironbark, Server Amberwave. \nServer Glacier is connected with Server Bluebird, Server Vortex, Server Glacierpeak. \nServer Eaglecrest is connected with Server Bluebird, Server Glacierpeak. \nServer Willowbrook is connected with Server Bluebird, Server Ironbark, Server Amberwave, Server Ghostwind, Server Vortex. \nServer Bluebird is connected with Server Ironbark, Server Amberwave. \nServer Ironbark is connected with Server Ghostwind. \nServer Amberwave is connected with Server Ghostwind. \nServer Ghostwind is connected with Server Vortex. \n",

  "Q": "Our company has 22 computers connected by several communication links. These computers are named: Server Stormbreaker, Server Crimsoncloud, Server Silverstone, Server Ironclad, Server Ghostwind, Server Amberwave, Server Sunflower, Server Mirage, Server Emberlight, Server Thunderstrike, Server Lighthouse, Server Eaglecrest, Server Twilight, Server Silverhawk, Server Goldleaf, Server Redwood, Server Windmill, Server Brightstar, Server Stormcloud, Server Skyhawk, Server Frostmoon and Server Solarflare. \nTo ensure network security, we need to install monitoring devices (such as firewalls or intrusion detection systems) on some of these computers so that all communication links are monitored. \nAssume that the connections between the computers (i.e., the communication links) are bidirectional. This means that information can flow in both directions across any link. Our goal is to deploy monitoring devices in a way that ensures all communication links are covered by at least one monitoring device. \nProblem: How can we select the minimum number of computers to deploy monitoring devices, such that every communication link is monitored by at least one device? \nCommunication links as follows: : \nServer Stormbreaker is connected with Server Crimsoncloud, Server Ghostwind, Server Amberwave, Server Sunflower, Server Emberlight, Server Eaglecrest, Server Twilight, Server Silverhawk, Server Goldleaf, Server Stormcloud, Server Frostmoon, Server Solarflare. \nServer Crimsoncloud is connected with Server Mirage, Server Emberlight, Server Thunderstrike, Server Twilight, Server Windmill, Server Brightstar, Server Skyhawk, Server Frostmoon. \nServer Silverstone is connected with Server Ghostwind, Server Mirage, Server Eaglecrest, Server Twilight, Server Goldleaf, Server Redwood, Server Windmill, Server Stormcloud, Server Skyhawk. \nServer Ironclad is connected with Server Amberwave, Server Sunflower, Server Emberlight, Server Lighthouse, Server Twilight, Server Silverhawk, Server Redwood, Server Windmill, Server Brightstar. \nServer Ghostwind is connected with Server Mirage, Server Silverhawk, Server Goldleaf, Server Redwood, Server Brightstar, Server Skyhawk, Server Solarflare. \nServer Amberwave is connected with Server Emberlight, Server Eaglecrest, Server Twilight, Server Redwood, Server Skyhawk, Server Frostmoon. \nServer Sunflower is connected with Server Mirage, Server Emberlight, Server Thunderstrike, Server Windmill, Server Brightstar, Server Stormcloud, Server Frostmoon. \nServer Mirage is connected with Server Emberlight, Server Lighthouse, Server Eaglecrest, Server Twilight, Server Goldleaf, Server Brightstar, Server Solarflare. \nServer Emberlight is connected with Server Eaglecrest, Server Redwood, Server Stormcloud, Server Frostmoon. \nServer Thunderstrike is connected with Server Lighthouse, Server Eaglecrest, Server Twilight, Server Goldleaf, Server Windmill, Server Brightstar, Server Skyhawk, Server Frostmoon, Server Solarflare. \nServer Lighthouse is connected with Server Eaglecrest, Server Windmill, Server Brightstar. \nServer Eaglecrest is connected with Server Silverhawk, Server Skyhawk. \nServer Twilight is connected with Server Silverhawk, Server Frostmoon. \nServer Silverhawk is connected with Server Redwood, Server Windmill. \nServer Goldleaf is connected with Server Skyhawk, Server Solarflare. \nServer Redwood is connected with Server Windmill, Server Stormcloud. \nServer Windmill is connected with Server Stormcloud, Server Frostmoon. \nServer Brightstar is connected with Server Solarflare. \nServer Stormcloud is connected with Server Skyhawk. \nServer Frostmoon is connected with Server Solarflare. \n",

  "Q": "Our company has 22 computers connected by several communication links. These computers are named: Server Silverhawk, Server Lighthouse, Server Brightstar, Server Mirage, Server Emberfall, Server Ironclad, Server Frostmoon, Server Goldleaf, Server Silverstream, Server Vortex, Server Sunflower, Server Willowbrook, Server Starfire, Server Nightfall, Server Shadowbrook, Server Blackwood, Server Glacierpeak, Server Firestorm, Server Moonlight, Server Falconeye, Server Ravenstone and Server Thunderstrike. \nTo ensure network security, we need to install monitoring devices (such as firewalls or intrusion detection systems) on some of these computers so that all communication links are monitored. \nAssume that the connections between the computers (i.e., the communication links) are bidirectional. This means that information can flow in both directions across any link. Our goal is to deploy monitoring devices in a way that ensures all communication links are covered by at least one monitoring device. \nProblem: How can we select the minimum number of computers to deploy monitoring devices, such that every communication link is monitored by at least one device? \nCommunication links as follows: : \nServer Silverhawk is connected with Server Mirage, Server Emberfall, Server Goldleaf, Server Vortex, Server Starfire, Server Nightfall, Server Glacierpeak, Server Firestorm, Server Moonlight. \nServer Lighthouse is connected with Server Mirage, Server Emberfall, Server Frostmoon, Server Goldleaf, Server Sunflower, Server Nightfall, Server Shadowbrook, Server Firestorm, Server Moonlight, Server Falconeye, Server Ravenstone, Server Thunderstrike. \nServer Brightstar is connected with Server Mirage, Server Ironclad, Server Silverstream, Server Vortex, Server Sunflower, Server Shadowbrook, Server Falconeye, Server Ravenstone. \nServer Mirage is connected with Server Frostmoon, Server Goldleaf, Server Silverstream, Server Starfire, Server Nightfall, Server Shadowbrook, Server Thunderstrike. \nServer Emberfall is connected with Server Ironclad, Server Frostmoon, Server Goldleaf, Server Moonlight, Server Ravenstone. \nServer Ironclad is connected with Server Frostmoon, Server Sunflower, Server Starfire, Server Glacierpeak, Server Firestorm, Server Thunderstrike. \nServer Frostmoon is connected with Server Silverstream, Server Nightfall, Server Blackwood, Server Glacierpeak, Server Thunderstrike. \nServer Goldleaf is connected with Server Vortex, Server Willowbrook, Server Moonlight, Server Falconeye, Server Ravenstone. \nServer Silverstream is connected with Server Sunflower, Server Willowbrook, Server Nightfall, Server Blackwood, Server Glacierpeak, Server Falconeye, Server Thunderstrike. \nServer Vortex is connected with Server Sunflower, Server Willowbrook, Server Nightfall, Server Blackwood, Server Firestorm, Server Moonlight. \nServer Sunflower is connected with Server Starfire, Server Shadowbrook, Server Glacierpeak, Server Firestorm, Server Ravenstone. \nServer Willowbrook is connected with Server Nightfall, Server Moonlight, Server Thunderstrike. \nServer Starfire is connected with Server Shadowbrook, Server Falconeye, Server Ravenstone. \nServer Nightfall is connected with Server Glacierpeak, Server Ravenstone. \nServer Shadowbrook is connected with Server Glacierpeak. \nServer Blackwood is connected with Server Glacierpeak, Server Moonlight. \nServer Glacierpeak is connected with Server Moonlight, Server Ravenstone, Server Thunderstrike. \nServer Firestorm is connected with Server Moonlight, Server Thunderstrike. \nServer Moonlight is connected with Server Falconeye, Server Ravenstone, Server Thunderstrike. \nServer Falconeye is connected with Server Thunderstrike. \nServer Ravenstone is connected with Server Thunderstrike. \n",

  "Q": "Our company has 22 computers connected by several communication links. These computers are named: Server Redwood, Server Glacierpeak, Server Ironbark, Server Windswept, Server Thunderbolt, Server Mirage, Server Goldleaf, Server Frostbite, Server Nightshade, Server Falconeye, Server Vortex, Server Moonlight, Server Silverstream, Server Sandstorm, Server Stealthwind, Server Windmill, Server Bluebird, Server Shadowbrook, Server Firefly, Server Starfire, Server Darkhorse and Server Seabreeze. \nTo ensure network security, we need to install monitoring devices (such as firewalls or intrusion detection systems) on some of these computers so that all communication links are monitored. \nAssume that the connections between the computers (i.e., the communication links) are bidirectional. This means that information can flow in both directions across any link. Our goal is to deploy monitoring devices in a way that ensures all communication links are covered by at least one monitoring device. \nProblem: How can we select the minimum number of computers to deploy monitoring devices, such that every communication link is monitored by at least one device? \nCommunication links as follows: : \nServer Redwood is connected with Server Thunderbolt, Server Nightshade, Server Falconeye, Server Vortex, Server Silverstream, Server Sandstorm, Server Bluebird, Server Firefly, Server Starfire, Server Darkhorse, Server Seabreeze. \nServer Glacierpeak is connected with Server Windswept, Server Mirage, Server Goldleaf, Server Moonlight, Server Sandstorm, Server Stealthwind, Server Windmill, Server Bluebird, Server Firefly, Server Darkhorse, Server Seabreeze. \nServer Ironbark is connected with Server Windswept, Server Mirage, Server Goldleaf, Server Falconeye, Server Silverstream, Server Windmill, Server Bluebird, Server Shadowbrook, Server Firefly. \nServer Windswept is connected with Server Goldleaf, Server Frostbite, Server Sandstorm, Server Windmill, Server Bluebird, Server Firefly, Server Starfire, Server Seabreeze. \nServer Thunderbolt is connected with Server Mirage, Server Goldleaf, Server Nightshade, Server Seabreeze. \nServer Mirage is connected with Server Nightshade, Server Falconeye, Server Moonlight, Server Silverstream, Server Sandstorm, Server Shadowbrook, Server Seabreeze. \nServer Goldleaf is connected with Server Nightshade, Server Falconeye, Server Windmill, Server Bluebird, Server Shadowbrook, Server Starfire, Server Darkhorse, Server Seabreeze. \nServer Frostbite is connected with Server Nightshade, Server Vortex, Server Moonlight, Server Silverstream, Server Stealthwind, Server Firefly, Server Seabreeze. \nServer Nightshade is connected with Server Falconeye, Server Moonlight, Server Stealthwind, Server Firefly, Server Starfire, Server Seabreeze. \nServer Falconeye is connected with Server Moonlight, Server Stealthwind. \nServer Vortex is connected with Server Windmill, Server Bluebird. \nServer Moonlight is connected with Server Sandstorm, Server Windmill, Server Starfire, Server Darkhorse. \nServer Silverstream is connected with Server Stealthwind, Server Seabreeze. \nServer Sandstorm is connected with Server Shadowbrook, Server Starfire. \nServer Stealthwind is connected with Server Bluebird, Server Shadowbrook, Server Starfire, Server Seabreeze. \nServer Windmill is connected with Server Shadowbrook, Server Firefly, Server Darkhorse. \nServer Bluebird is connected with Server Firefly, Server Seabreeze. \nServer Shadowbrook is connected with Server Starfire. \nServer Firefly is connected with Server Seabreeze. \nServer Starfire is connected with Server Darkhorse. \nServer Darkhorse is connected with Server Seabreeze. \n",

  "Q": "Our company has 22 computers connected by several communication links. These computers are named: Server Vortex, Server Frostmoon, Server Starfire, Server Firefly, Server Blackwood, Server Tempest, Server Moonlight, Server Bluewave, Server Silverstream, Server Lighthouse, Server Shadowbrook, Server Ghostwind, Server Willowbrook, Server Darkhorse, Server Bluebird, Server Amberwave, Server Ironbark, Server Oceanview, Server Ravenstone, Server Thunderbolt, Server Sandstorm and Server Crimsoncloud. \nTo ensure network security, we need to install monitoring devices (such as firewalls or intrusion detection systems) on some of these computers so that all communication links are monitored. \nAssume that the connections between the computers (i.e., the communication links) are bidirectional. This means that information can flow in both directions across any link. Our goal is to deploy monitoring devices in a way that ensures all communication links are covered by at least one monitoring device. \nProblem: How can we select the minimum number of computers to deploy monitoring devices, such that every communication link is monitored by at least one device? \nCommunication links as follows: : \nServer Vortex is connected with Server Firefly, Server Blackwood, Server Tempest, Server Bluewave, Server Ghostwind, Server Willowbrook, Server Darkhorse, Server Bluebird, Server Ravenstone, Server Thunderbolt, Server Sandstorm. \nServer Frostmoon is connected with Server Firefly, Server Tempest, Server Lighthouse, Server Darkhorse. \nServer Starfire is connected with Server Tempest, Server Silverstream, Server Ghostwind, Server Willowbrook, Server Bluebird, Server Amberwave, Server Oceanview. \nServer Firefly is connected with Server Blackwood, Server Moonlight, Server Lighthouse, Server Willowbrook, Server Bluebird, Server Amberwave, Server Oceanview, Server Thunderbolt, Server Crimsoncloud. \nServer Blackwood is connected with Server Moonlight, Server Ghostwind, Server Darkhorse, Server Bluebird, Server Ironbark, Server Oceanview, Server Ravenstone, Server Sandstorm. \nServer Tempest is connected with Server Moonlight, Server Silverstream, Server Lighthouse, Server Shadowbrook, Server Ghostwind, Server Willowbrook, Server Bluebird, Server Oceanview, Server Ravenstone, Server Sandstorm. \nServer Moonlight is connected with Server Lighthouse, Server Shadowbrook, Server Darkhorse, Server Bluebird, Server Sandstorm, Server Crimsoncloud. \nServer Bluewave is connected with Server Lighthouse, Server Darkhorse, Server Bluebird, Server Ironbark, Server Thunderbolt, Server Crimsoncloud. \nServer Silverstream is connected with Server Shadowbrook, Server Willowbrook, Server Ironbark, Server Sandstorm. \nServer Lighthouse is connected with Server Shadowbrook, Server Ironbark, Server Ravenstone, Server Thunderbolt, Server Crimsoncloud. \nServer Shadowbrook is connected with Server Ghostwind, Server Darkhorse, Server Amberwave, Server Thunderbolt, Server Crimsoncloud. \nServer Ghostwind is connected with Server Darkhorse, Server Amberwave, Server Ravenstone, Server Thunderbolt. \nServer Willowbrook is connected with Server Darkhorse, Server Thunderbolt, Server Sandstorm. \nServer Darkhorse is connected with Server Amberwave, Server Oceanview, Server Crimsoncloud. \nServer Bluebird is connected with Server Amberwave, Server Ravenstone, Server Thunderbolt, Server Sandstorm, Server Crimsoncloud. \nServer Amberwave is connected with Server Thunderbolt, Server Crimsoncloud. \nServer Ravenstone is connected with Server Thunderbolt. \nServer Thunderbolt is connected with Server Sandstorm, Server Crimsoncloud. \nServer Sandstorm is connected with Server Crimsoncloud. \n",

  "Q": "Our company has 22 computers connected by several communication links. These computers are named: Server Glacierpeak, Server Ravenstone, Server Sunflower, Server Frostmoon, Server Ironclad, Server Stealthwind, Server Seabreeze, Server Frostbite, Server Goldleaf, Server Solarflare, Server Thunderbolt, Server Moonlight, Server Twilight, Server Windswept, Server Firestorm, Server Willowbrook, Server Ghostwind, Server Silverhawk, Server Brightstar, Server Nightshade, Server Skyhawk and Server Silverstream. \nTo ensure network security, we need to install monitoring devices (such as firewalls or intrusion detection systems) on some of these computers so that all communication links are monitored. \nAssume that the connections between the computers (i.e., the communication links) are bidirectional. This means that information can flow in both directions across any link. Our goal is to deploy monitoring devices in a way that ensures all communication links are covered by at least one monitoring device. \nProblem: How can we select the minimum number of computers to deploy monitoring devices, such that every communication link is monitored by at least one device? \nCommunication links as follows: : \nServer Glacierpeak is connected with Server Sunflower, Server Frostmoon, Server Stealthwind, Server Solarflare, Server Moonlight, Server Willowbrook. \nServer Ravenstone is connected with Server Ironclad, Server Stealthwind, Server Seabreeze, Server Solarflare, Server Moonlight, Server Firestorm, Server Ghostwind, Server Brightstar, Server Skyhawk, Server Silverstream. \nServer Sunflower is connected with Server Frostmoon, Server Frostbite, Server Goldleaf, Server Thunderbolt, Server Twilight, Server Windswept, Server Willowbrook, Server Ghostwind, Server Silverhawk, Server Brightstar, Server Nightshade, Server Silverstream. \nServer Frostmoon is connected with Server Ironclad, Server Stealthwind, Server Seabreeze, Server Solarflare, Server Silverhawk, Server Nightshade, Server Skyhawk, Server Silverstream. \nServer Ironclad is connected with Server Stealthwind, Server Goldleaf, Server Thunderbolt, Server Twilight, Server Firestorm, Server Silverhawk, Server Skyhawk. \nServer Stealthwind is connected with Server Frostbite, Server Willowbrook, Server Ghostwind. \nServer Seabreeze is connected with Server Goldleaf, Server Solarflare, Server Thunderbolt, Server Moonlight, Server Twilight, Server Windswept, Server Willowbrook, Server Brightstar, Server Silverstream. \nServer Frostbite is connected with Server Goldleaf, Server Solarflare, Server Thunderbolt, Server Windswept, Server Silverhawk, Server Brightstar. \nServer Goldleaf is connected with Server Willowbrook, Server Ghostwind, Server Silverhawk, Server Silverstream. \nServer Solarflare is connected with Server Thunderbolt, Server Moonlight, Server Twilight, Server Ghostwind, Server Skyhawk. \nServer Thunderbolt is connected with Server Nightshade, Server Skyhawk. \nServer Moonlight is connected with Server Windswept, Server Ghostwind, Server Silverhawk, Server Nightshade, Server Skyhawk, Server Silverstream. \nServer Twilight is connected with Server Windswept, Server Willowbrook, Server Ghostwind, Server Nightshade, Server Skyhawk. \nServer Windswept is connected with Server Firestorm, Server Ghostwind, Server Brightstar, Server Nightshade, Server Skyhawk, Server Silverstream. \nServer Firestorm is connected with Server Ghostwind, Server Silverhawk. \nServer Willowbrook is connected with Server Ghostwind. \nServer Ghostwind is connected with Server Brightstar, Server Nightshade. \nServer Silverhawk is connected with Server Skyhawk. \nServer Brightstar is connected with Server Nightshade. \n",

  "Q": "Our company has 22 computers connected by several communication links. These computers are named: Server Eaglecrest, Server Stealthwind, Server Nightfall, Server Stormbreaker, Server Moonlight, Server Nightshade, Server Starfire, Server Sandstorm, Server Stormcloud, Server Tempest, Server Windmill, Server Ironbark, Server Amberwave, Server Silverstone, Server Sunflower, Server Vortex, Server Windswept, Server Redwood, Server Willowbrook, Server Glacierpeak, Server Shadowbrook and Server Silverstream. \nTo ensure network security, we need to install monitoring devices (such as firewalls or intrusion detection systems) on some of these computers so that all communication links are monitored. \nAssume that the connections between the computers (i.e., the communication links) are bidirectional. This means that information can flow in both directions across any link. Our goal is to deploy monitoring devices in a way that ensures all communication links are covered by at least one monitoring device. \nProblem: How can we select the minimum number of computers to deploy monitoring devices, such that every communication link is monitored by at least one device? \nCommunication links as follows: : \nServer Eaglecrest is connected with Server Stealthwind, Server Stormbreaker, Server Moonlight, Server Nightshade, Server Sandstorm, Server Stormcloud, Server Tempest, Server Ironbark, Server Silverstone, Server Vortex, Server Redwood, Server Shadowbrook. \nServer Stealthwind is connected with Server Nightshade, Server Sandstorm, Server Stormcloud, Server Windmill, Server Ironbark, Server Amberwave, Server Sunflower, Server Redwood, Server Glacierpeak. \nServer Nightfall is connected with Server Nightshade, Server Sandstorm, Server Stormcloud, Server Silverstone, Server Windswept, Server Willowbrook, Server Glacierpeak. \nServer Stormbreaker is connected with Server Moonlight, Server Starfire, Server Stormcloud, Server Ironbark, Server Windswept, Server Redwood, Server Willowbrook, Server Glacierpeak. \nServer Moonlight is connected with Server Nightshade, Server Starfire, Server Sandstorm, Server Stormcloud, Server Sunflower, Server Willowbrook. \nServer Nightshade is connected with Server Starfire, Server Sandstorm, Server Stormcloud, Server Tempest, Server Ironbark, Server Sunflower, Server Vortex, Server Glacierpeak. \nServer Starfire is connected with Server Tempest, Server Windmill, Server Amberwave, Server Vortex, Server Shadowbrook, Server Silverstream. \nServer Sandstorm is connected with Server Stormcloud, Server Windmill, Server Amberwave, Server Silverstone, Server Windswept, Server Glacierpeak, Server Shadowbrook, Server Silverstream. \nServer Stormcloud is connected with Server Redwood, Server Willowbrook, Server Glacierpeak, Server Silverstream. \nServer Tempest is connected with Server Windmill, Server Amberwave, Server Silverstone, Server Sunflower, Server Vortex, Server Windswept, Server Willowbrook, Server Glacierpeak. \nServer Windmill is connected with Server Ironbark, Server Silverstone, Server Vortex, Server Glacierpeak, Server Silverstream. \nServer Ironbark is connected with Server Amberwave, Server Windswept, Server Willowbrook. \nServer Amberwave is connected with Server Silverstone, Server Windswept, Server Redwood, Server Willowbrook. \nServer Silverstone is connected with Server Willowbrook. \nServer Sunflower is connected with Server Glacierpeak, Server Shadowbrook, Server Silverstream. \nServer Vortex is connected with Server Windswept, Server Shadowbrook. \nServer Willowbrook is connected with Server Glacierpeak. \nServer Shadowbrook is connected with Server Silverstream. \n",
