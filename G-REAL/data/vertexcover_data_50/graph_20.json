These computers are named: Server Moonlight, Server Stormcloud, Server Bluebird, Server Nightshade, Server Nightfall, Server Eaglecrest, Server Brightstar, Server Silverstone, Server Firefly, Server Thunderstrike, Server Mirage, Server Willowbrook, Server Darkhorse, Server Silverhawk, Server Sandstorm, Server Emberlight, Server Ironbark, Server Oceanview, Server Silverstream and Server Ravenstone. \nTo ensure network security, we need to install monitoring devices (such as firewalls or intrusion detection systems) on some of these computers so that all communication links are monitored. \nAssume that the connections between the computers (i.e., the communication links) are bidirectional. This means that information can flow in both directions across any link. Our goal is to deploy monitoring devices in a way that ensures all communication links are covered by at least one monitoring device. \nProblem: How can we select the minimum number of computers to deploy monitoring devices, such that every communication link is monitored by at least one device? \nCommunication links as follows: : \nServer Moonlight is connected with Server Nightshade, Server Nightfall, Server Eaglecrest, Server Brightstar, Server Darkhorse, Server Silverhawk, Server Sandstorm, Server Emberlight, Server Silverstream. \nServer Stormcloud is connected with Server Eaglecrest, Server Willowbrook, Server Darkhorse, Server Emberlight, Server Silverstream, Server Ravenstone. \nServer Bluebird is connected with Server Nightshade, Server Nightfall, Server Brightstar, Server Thunderstrike, Server Sandstorm, Server Emberlight. \nServer Nightshade is connected with Server Nightfall, Server Brightstar, Server Silverhawk, Server Emberlight, Server Oceanview, Server Ravenstone. \nServer Nightfall is connected with Server Eaglecrest, Server Willowbrook, Server Darkhorse, Server Sandstorm, Server Ironbark, Server Oceanview, Server Silverstream. \nServer Eaglecrest is connected with Server Brightstar, Server Firefly, Server Willowbrook, Server Silverhawk, Server Sandstorm, Server Ironbark. \nServer Brightstar is connected with Server Mirage, Server Willowbrook, Server Sandstorm, Server Ironbark. \nServer Silverstone is connected with Server Firefly, Server Thunderstrike, Server Mirage, Server Willowbrook, Server Silverhawk, Server Sandstorm, Server Ironbark. \nServer Firefly is connected with Server Darkhorse, Server Sandstorm, Server Emberlight, Server Ironbark. \nServer Thunderstrike is connected with Server Mirage, Server Silverhawk, Server Emberlight, Server Ironbark, Server Oceanview, Server Silverstream. \nServer Mirage is connected with Server Darkhorse, Server Silverhawk, Server Sandstorm, Server Ironbark, Server Ravenstone. \nServer Willowbrook is connected with Server Sandstorm, Server Emberlight, Server Silverstream. \nServer Darkhorse is connected with Server Silverhawk, Server Sandstorm, Server Emberlight, Server Ironbark. \nServer Silverhawk is connected with Server Emberlight, Server Silverstream. \nServer Emberlight is connected with Server Oceanview. \nServer Ironbark is connected with Server Oceanview, Server Ravenstone. \nServer Oceanview is connected with Server Silverstream. \nServer Silverstream is connected with Server Ravenstone. \n",

These computers are named: Server Stealthwind, Server Mirage, Server Shadowbrook, Server Vortex, Server Silverstone, Server Frostbite, Server Ironclad, Server Nightshade, Server Ironbark, Server Moonlight, Server Crimsoncloud, Server Falconeye, Server Glacierpeak, Server Nightfall, Server Starfire, Server Emberfall, Server Bluewave, Server Windswept, Server Redwood and Server Frostmoon. \nTo ensure network security, we need to install monitoring devices (such as firewalls or intrusion detection systems) on some of these computers so that all communication links are monitored. \nAssume that the connections between the computers (i.e., the communication links) are bidirectional. This means that information can flow in both directions across any link. Our goal is to deploy monitoring devices in a way that ensures all communication links are covered by at least one monitoring device. \nProblem: How can we select the minimum number of computers to deploy monitoring devices, such that every communication link is monitored by at least one device? \nCommunication links as follows: : \nServer Stealthwind is connected with Server Mirage, Server Shadowbrook, Server Silverstone, Server Frostbite, Server Nightshade, Server Crimsoncloud, Server Falconeye, Server Nightfall, Server Windswept, Server Redwood, Server Frostmoon. \nServer Mirage is connected with Server Frostbite, Server Ironbark, Server Moonlight, Server Crimsoncloud, Server Falconeye, Server Glacierpeak, Server Emberfall, Server Windswept. \nServer Shadowbrook is connected with Server Nightshade, Server Ironbark, Server Nightfall, Server Starfire, Server Emberfall. \nServer Vortex is connected with Server Nightshade, Server Ironbark, Server Crimsoncloud, Server Falconeye, Server Bluewave, Server Redwood. \nServer Silverstone is connected with Server Frostbite, Server Ironclad, Server Nightshade, Server Falconeye, Server Starfire, Server Emberfall, Server Windswept, Server Frostmoon. \nServer Frostbite is connected with Server Ironclad, Server Nightshade, Server Moonlight, Server Glacierpeak, Server Emberfall, Server Windswept. \nServer Ironclad is connected with Server Moonlight, Server Crimsoncloud, Server Falconeye, Server Glacierpeak, Server Nightfall, Server Emberfall, Server Windswept, Server Frostmoon. \nServer Nightshade is connected with Server Crimsoncloud, Server Glacierpeak, Server Windswept, Server Redwood. \nServer Ironbark is connected with Server Falconeye, Server Nightfall, Server Starfire, Server Windswept, Server Redwood. \nServer Moonlight is connected with Server Crimsoncloud, Server Falconeye, Server Glacierpeak, Server Starfire, Server Redwood. \nServer Crimsoncloud is connected with Server Nightfall, Server Emberfall, Server Bluewave. \nServer Falconeye is connected with Server Starfire, Server Windswept, Server Redwood. \nServer Glacierpeak is connected with Server Starfire, Server Emberfall. \nServer Nightfall is connected with Server Starfire, Server Bluewave, Server Frostmoon. \nServer Starfire is connected with Server Windswept, Server Frostmoon. \nServer Bluewave is connected with Server Frostmoon. \n",

  "Q": "Our company has 20 computers connected by several communication links. These computers are named: Server Thunderstrike, Server Skyhawk, Server Glacier, Server Thunderbolt, Server Redwood, Server Ironclad, Server Ghostwind, Server Starfire, Server Bluebird, Server Frostmoon, Server Tempest, Server Windswept, Server Willowbrook, Server Silverstream, Server Nightshade, Server Firefly, Server Falconeye, Server Bluewave, Server Crimsoncloud and Server Blackwood. \nTo ensure network security, we need to install monitoring devices (such as firewalls or intrusion detection systems) on some of these computers so that all communication links are monitored. \nAssume that the connections between the computers (i.e., the communication links) are bidirectional. This means that information can flow in both directions across any link. Our goal is to deploy monitoring devices in a way that ensures all communication links are covered by at least one monitoring device. \nProblem: How can we select the minimum number of computers to deploy monitoring devices, such that every communication link is monitored by at least one device? \nCommunication links as follows: : \nServer Thunderstrike is connected with Server Frostmoon, Server Tempest, Server Falconeye, Server Crimsoncloud. \nServer Skyhawk is connected with Server Glacier, Server Starfire, Server Frostmoon, Server Tempest, Server Windswept, Server Silverstream, Server Firefly, Server Falconeye, Server Crimsoncloud. \nServer Glacier is connected with Server Ghostwind, Server Frostmoon, Server Tempest, Server Silverstream, Server Firefly, Server Bluewave, Server Crimsoncloud, Server Blackwood. \nServer Thunderbolt is connected with Server Ironclad, Server Windswept, Server Willowbrook, Server Silverstream, Server Nightshade, Server Falconeye, Server Bluewave, Server Crimsoncloud, Server Blackwood. \nServer Redwood is connected with Server Ghostwind, Server Tempest, Server Willowbrook, Server Silverstream, Server Nightshade, Server Falconeye, Server Bluewave, Server Crimsoncloud. \nServer Ironclad is connected with Server Windswept, Server Willowbrook, Server Falconeye. \nServer Ghostwind is connected with Server Windswept, Server Nightshade, Server Crimsoncloud, Server Blackwood. \nServer Starfire is connected with Server Frostmoon, Server Tempest, Server Nightshade, Server Blackwood. \nServer Bluebird is connected with Server Tempest, Server Firefly, Server Falconeye, Server Bluewave, Server Blackwood. \nServer Frostmoon is connected with Server Tempest, Server Windswept, Server Silverstream, Server Nightshade, Server Falconeye, Server Crimsoncloud. \nServer Tempest is connected with Server Nightshade, Server Blackwood. \nServer Windswept is connected with Server Silverstream, Server Firefly, Server Falconeye, Server Crimsoncloud, Server Blackwood. \nServer Willowbrook is connected with Server Silverstream, Server Falconeye. \nServer Silverstream is connected with Server Falconeye, Server Crimsoncloud, Server Blackwood. \nServer Nightshade is connected with Server Falconeye. \nServer Firefly is connected with Server Bluewave, Server Crimsoncloud, Server Blackwood. \nServer Falconeye is connected with Server Bluewave, Server Crimsoncloud. \nServer Bluewave is connected with Server Crimsoncloud. \nServer Crimsoncloud is connected with Server Blackwood. \n",

These computers are named: Server Brightstar, Server Firestorm, Server Sunflower, Server Glacierpeak, Server Falconeye, Server Redwood, Server Willowbrook, Server Goldleaf, Server Stormcloud, Server Emberfall, Server Frostmoon, Server Windswept, Server Oceanview, Server Bluebird, Server Thunderbolt, Server Lighthouse, Server Emberlight, Server Skyhawk, Server Thunderstrike and Server Eaglecrest. \nTo ensure network security, we need to install monitoring devices (such as firewalls or intrusion detection systems) on some of these computers so that all communication links are monitored. \nAssume that the connections between the computers (i.e., the communication links) are bidirectional. This means that information can flow in both directions across any link. Our goal is to deploy monitoring devices in a way that ensures all communication links are covered by at least one monitoring device. \nProblem: How can we select the minimum number of computers to deploy monitoring devices, such that every communication link is monitored by at least one device? \nCommunication links as follows: : \nServer Brightstar is connected with Server Sunflower, Server Glacierpeak, Server Willowbrook, Server Stormcloud, Server Frostmoon, Server Oceanview, Server Bluebird. \nServer Firestorm is connected with Server Glacierpeak, Server Eaglecrest. \nServer Sunflower is connected with Server Redwood, Server Goldleaf, Server Stormcloud, Server Windswept, Server Bluebird, Server Thunderbolt, Server Emberlight, Server Skyhawk, Server Thunderstrike, Server Eaglecrest. \nServer Glacierpeak is connected with Server Falconeye, Server Redwood, Server Stormcloud, Server Emberfall, Server Windswept, Server Oceanview, Server Bluebird, Server Thunderbolt, Server Emberlight. \nServer Falconeye is connected with Server Stormcloud, Server Frostmoon, Server Oceanview, Server Thunderbolt, Server Skyhawk, Server Eaglecrest. \nServer Redwood is connected with Server Goldleaf, Server Stormcloud, Server Windswept, Server Thunderbolt, Server Skyhawk, Server Thunderstrike. \nServer Willowbrook is connected with Server Emberfall, Server Frostmoon, Server Bluebird, Server Thunderbolt, Server Lighthouse, Server Emberlight. \nServer Goldleaf is connected with Server Emberfall, Server Frostmoon, Server Thunderbolt, Server Eaglecrest. \nServer Stormcloud is connected with Server Frostmoon, Server Windswept, Server Oceanview, Server Thunderbolt, Server Lighthouse, Server Emberlight, Server Skyhawk, Server Thunderstrike, Server Eaglecrest. \nServer Emberfall is connected with Server Oceanview, Server Bluebird, Server Thunderbolt, Server Eaglecrest. \nServer Frostmoon is connected with Server Thunderbolt, Server Lighthouse. \nServer Windswept is connected with Server Thunderbolt, Server Lighthouse, Server Thunderstrike. \nServer Oceanview is connected with Server Skyhawk. \nServer Bluebird is connected with Server Thunderbolt, Server Emberlight, Server Eaglecrest. \nServer Thunderbolt is connected with Server Lighthouse, Server Emberlight, Server Skyhawk, Server Eaglecrest. \nServer Lighthouse is connected with Server Emberlight, Server Skyhawk. \nServer Emberlight is connected with Server Thunderstrike. \nServer Thunderstrike is connected with Server Eaglecrest. \n",

  "Q": "Our company has 20 computers connected by several communication links. These computers are named: Server Seabreeze, Server Blackwood, Server Goldleaf, Server Silverstream, Server Bluewave, Server Emberfall, Server Twilight, Server Brightstar, Server Willowbrook, Server Silverhawk, Server Nightfall, Server Sandstorm, Server Bluebird, Server Firestorm, Server Glacierpeak, Server Vortex, Server Ghostwind, Server Solarflare, Server Amberwave and Server Lighthouse. \nTo ensure network security, we need to install monitoring devices (such as firewalls or intrusion detection systems) on some of these computers so that all communication links are monitored. \nAssume that the connections between the computers (i.e., the communication links) are bidirectional. This means that information can flow in both directions across any link. Our goal is to deploy monitoring devices in a way that ensures all communication links are covered by at least one monitoring device. \nProblem: How can we select the minimum number of computers to deploy monitoring devices, such that every communication link is monitored by at least one device? \nCommunication links as follows: : \nServer Seabreeze is connected with Server Blackwood, Server Silverstream, Server Brightstar, Server Willowbrook, Server Firestorm, Server Glacierpeak, Server Ghostwind, Server Solarflare, Server Lighthouse. \nServer Blackwood is connected with Server Emberfall, Server Silverhawk, Server Nightfall, Server Firestorm, Server Glacierpeak, Server Vortex, Server Ghostwind, Server Solarflare, Server Lighthouse. \nServer Goldleaf is connected with Server Bluewave, Server Twilight, Server Willowbrook, Server Nightfall, Server Sandstorm, Server Glacierpeak, Server Vortex, Server Solarflare, Server Lighthouse. \nServer Silverstream is connected with Server Emberfall, Server Willowbrook, Server Sandstorm, Server Firestorm, Server Glacierpeak, Server Vortex, Server Ghostwind. \nServer Bluewave is connected with Server Brightstar, Server Silverhawk, Server Bluebird, Server Firestorm, Server Amberwave, Server Lighthouse. \nServer Emberfall is connected with Server Brightstar, Server Nightfall, Server Vortex, Server Ghostwind. \nServer Twilight is connected with Server Brightstar, Server Willowbrook, Server Nightfall, Server Ghostwind, Server Solarflare, Server Amberwave. \nServer Brightstar is connected with Server Willowbrook, Server Nightfall, Server Sandstorm, Server Bluebird. \nServer Willowbrook is connected with Server Sandstorm, Server Bluebird, Server Ghostwind. \nServer Silverhawk is connected with Server Nightfall, Server Glacierpeak, Server Solarflare, Server Amberwave, Server Lighthouse. \nServer Nightfall is connected with Server Sandstorm, Server Bluebird, Server Vortex, Server Ghostwind, Server Solarflare, Server Amberwave. \nServer Sandstorm is connected with Server Bluebird, Server Firestorm, Server Amberwave. \nServer Bluebird is connected with Server Glacierpeak, Server Ghostwind. \nServer Firestorm is connected with Server Ghostwind, Server Solarflare, Server Amberwave. \nServer Glacierpeak is connected with Server Ghostwind. \nServer Ghostwind is connected with Server Amberwave, Server Lighthouse. \nServer Solarflare is connected with Server Lighthouse. \n",

These computers are named: Server Ironclad, Server Sandstorm, Server Willowbrook, Server Glacier, Server Thunderstrike, Server Silverstream, Server Darkhorse, Server Stormbreaker, Server Bluebird, Server Bluewave, Server Shadowbrook, Server Amberwave, Server Seabreeze, Server Blackwood, Server Brightstar, Server Silverstone, Server Silverhawk, Server Lighthouse, Server Stealthwind and Server Falconeye. \nTo ensure network security, we need to install monitoring devices (such as firewalls or intrusion detection systems) on some of these computers so that all communication links are monitored. \nAssume that the connections between the computers (i.e., the communication links) are bidirectional. This means that information can flow in both directions across any link. Our goal is to deploy monitoring devices in a way that ensures all communication links are covered by at least one monitoring device. \nProblem: How can we select the minimum number of computers to deploy monitoring devices, such that every communication link is monitored by at least one device? \nCommunication links as follows: : \nServer Ironclad is connected with Server Glacier, Server Silverstream, Server Bluebird, Server Bluewave, Server Shadowbrook, Server Silverstone, Server Silverhawk. \nServer Sandstorm is connected with Server Thunderstrike, Server Darkhorse, Server Seabreeze, Server Brightstar, Server Stealthwind, Server Falconeye. \nServer Willowbrook is connected with Server Silverstream, Server Shadowbrook, Server Brightstar, Server Stealthwind, Server Falconeye. \nServer Glacier is connected with Server Thunderstrike, Server Silverstream, Server Darkhorse, Server Bluewave, Server Shadowbrook, Server Blackwood, Server Brightstar, Server Silverhawk, Server Stealthwind, Server Falconeye. \nServer Thunderstrike is connected with Server Darkhorse, Server Stormbreaker, Server Bluewave, Server Amberwave, Server Blackwood, Server Silverstone, Server Silverhawk, Server Lighthouse. \nServer Silverstream is connected with Server Darkhorse, Server Stormbreaker, Server Bluewave, Server Blackwood, Server Brightstar, Server Silverstone, Server Stealthwind. \nServer Darkhorse is connected with Server Blackwood, Server Silverhawk, Server Lighthouse, Server Falconeye. \nServer Stormbreaker is connected with Server Bluebird, Server Bluewave, Server Amberwave, Server Blackwood, Server Lighthouse, Server Stealthwind. \nServer Bluebird is connected with Server Bluewave, Server Stealthwind. \nServer Bluewave is connected with Server Amberwave. \nServer Shadowbrook is connected with Server Amberwave, Server Silverstone, Server Lighthouse, Server Stealthwind, Server Falconeye. \nServer Amberwave is connected with Server Seabreeze, Server Blackwood, Server Silverstone, Server Silverhawk, Server Lighthouse, Server Stealthwind. \nServer Seabreeze is connected with Server Silverhawk, Server Stealthwind. \nServer Blackwood is connected with Server Lighthouse, Server Falconeye. \nServer Brightstar is connected with Server Silverhawk, Server Lighthouse. \nServer Silverstone is connected with Server Silverhawk, Server Lighthouse, Server Stealthwind, Server Falconeye. \nServer Silverhawk is connected with Server Lighthouse. \nServer Lighthouse is connected with Server Falconeye. \nServer Stealthwind is connected with Server Falconeye. \n",

  "Q": "Our company has 20 computers connected by several communication links. These computers are named: Server Bluebird, Server Sunflower, Server Bluewave, Server Emberlight, Server Glacierpeak, Server Nightshade, Server Ironbark, Server Stormcloud, Server Seabreeze, Server Ghostwind, Server Goldleaf, Server Stormbreaker, Server Tempest, Server Nightfall, Server Shadowbrook, Server Amberwave, Server Windswept, Server Oceanview, Server Starfire and Server Crimsoncloud. \nTo ensure network security, we need to install monitoring devices (such as firewalls or intrusion detection systems) on some of these computers so that all communication links are monitored. \nAssume that the connections between the computers (i.e., the communication links) are bidirectional. This means that information can flow in both directions across any link. Our goal is to deploy monitoring devices in a way that ensures all communication links are covered by at least one monitoring device. \nProblem: How can we select the minimum number of computers to deploy monitoring devices, such that every communication link is monitored by at least one device? \nCommunication links as follows: : \nServer Bluebird is connected with Server Bluewave, Server Glacierpeak, Server Nightshade, Server Stormcloud, Server Stormbreaker, Server Tempest, Server Nightfall, Server Windswept, Server Oceanview, Server Crimsoncloud. \nServer Sunflower is connected with Server Glacierpeak, Server Nightshade, Server Seabreeze, Server Goldleaf, Server Tempest, Server Amberwave, Server Oceanview, Server Crimsoncloud. \nServer Bluewave is connected with Server Glacierpeak, Server Nightshade, Server Ironbark, Server Stormbreaker, Server Tempest, Server Starfire. \nServer Emberlight is connected with Server Shadowbrook, Server Starfire, Server Crimsoncloud. \nServer Glacierpeak is connected with Server Ironbark, Server Stormbreaker, Server Tempest, Server Shadowbrook, Server Amberwave, Server Windswept, Server Starfire, Server Crimsoncloud. \nServer Nightshade is connected with Server Ironbark, Server Stormbreaker, Server Amberwave, Server Starfire. \nServer Ironbark is connected with Server Seabreeze, Server Ghostwind, Server Stormbreaker, Server Shadowbrook. \nServer Stormcloud is connected with Server Ghostwind, Server Stormbreaker, Server Nightfall, Server Amberwave, Server Windswept, Server Starfire. \nServer Seabreeze is connected with Server Goldleaf, Server Tempest, Server Crimsoncloud. \nServer Ghostwind is connected with Server Goldleaf, Server Tempest, Server Nightfall, Server Shadowbrook, Server Amberwave, Server Windswept, Server Oceanview. \nServer Goldleaf is connected with Server Stormbreaker, Server Nightfall, Server Amberwave, Server Oceanview. \nServer Stormbreaker is connected with Server Tempest, Server Amberwave. \nServer Tempest is connected with Server Windswept, Server Crimsoncloud. \nServer Nightfall is connected with Server Shadowbrook, Server Amberwave, Server Oceanview. \nServer Shadowbrook is connected with Server Windswept, Server Oceanview. \nServer Amberwave is connected with Server Windswept, Server Oceanview, Server Starfire, Server Crimsoncloud. \nServer Windswept is connected with Server Oceanview, Server Crimsoncloud. \nServer Oceanview is connected with Server Starfire. \nServer Starfire is connected with Server Crimsoncloud. \n",

These computers are named: Server Bluewave, Server Frostbite, Server Emberlight, Server Bluebird, Server Skyhawk, Server Darkhorse, Server Solarflare, Server Sandstorm, Server Glacierpeak, Server Amberwave, Server Firefly, Server Starfire, Server Tempest, Server Firestorm, Server Moonlight, Server Eaglecrest, Server Ghostwind, Server Stormcloud, Server Ravenstone and Server Windmill. \nTo ensure network security, we need to install monitoring devices (such as firewalls or intrusion detection systems) on some of these computers so that all communication links are monitored. \nAssume that the connections between the computers (i.e., the communication links) are bidirectional. This means that information can flow in both directions across any link. Our goal is to deploy monitoring devices in a way that ensures all communication links are covered by at least one monitoring device. \nProblem: How can we select the minimum number of computers to deploy monitoring devices, such that every communication link is monitored by at least one device? \nCommunication links as follows: : \nServer Bluewave is connected with Server Frostbite, Server Bluebird, Server Skyhawk, Server Darkhorse, Server Sandstorm, Server Amberwave, Server Starfire, Server Moonlight, Server Eaglecrest, Server Ravenstone, Server Windmill. \nServer Frostbite is connected with Server Darkhorse, Server Sandstorm, Server Starfire, Server Tempest, Server Moonlight, Server Ghostwind, Server Ravenstone. \nServer Emberlight is connected with Server Bluebird, Server Solarflare, Server Amberwave, Server Firefly, Server Starfire, Server Firestorm, Server Ravenstone. \nServer Bluebird is connected with Server Skyhawk, Server Darkhorse, Server Amberwave, Server Starfire, Server Tempest, Server Ravenstone, Server Windmill. \nServer Skyhawk is connected with Server Solarflare, Server Sandstorm, Server Amberwave, Server Tempest, Server Moonlight, Server Ravenstone, Server Windmill. \nServer Darkhorse is connected with Server Sandstorm, Server Glacierpeak, Server Starfire, Server Ghostwind, Server Ravenstone. \nServer Solarflare is connected with Server Glacierpeak, Server Firefly, Server Tempest, Server Ghostwind. \nServer Sandstorm is connected with Server Amberwave, Server Firefly, Server Eaglecrest, Server Ghostwind, Server Stormcloud, Server Windmill. \nServer Glacierpeak is connected with Server Eaglecrest, Server Ghostwind, Server Stormcloud, Server Windmill. \nServer Amberwave is connected with Server Firestorm, Server Moonlight, Server Eaglecrest, Server Ghostwind. \nServer Firefly is connected with Server Tempest, Server Moonlight, Server Ghostwind, Server Stormcloud, Server Ravenstone, Server Windmill. \nServer Starfire is connected with Server Firestorm, Server Eaglecrest, Server Ravenstone. \nServer Tempest is connected with Server Stormcloud. \nServer Firestorm is connected with Server Ghostwind. \nServer Moonlight is connected with Server Eaglecrest, Server Windmill. \nServer Eaglecrest is connected with Server Ghostwind, Server Ravenstone, Server Windmill. \nServer Ghostwind is connected with Server Stormcloud, Server Ravenstone. \n",
