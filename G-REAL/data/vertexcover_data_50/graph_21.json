These computers are named: Server Goldleaf, Server Windmill, Server Silverstone, Server Firefly, Server Blackwood, Server Sandstorm, Server Amberwave, Server Bluebird, Server Mirage, Server Thunderstrike, Server Stormcloud, Server Ironbark, Server Emberfall, Server Falconeye, Server Nightfall, Server Frostbite, Server Stormbreaker, Server Glacier, Server Emberlight, Server Frostmoon and Server Moonlight. \nTo ensure network security, we need to install monitoring devices (such as firewalls or intrusion detection systems) on some of these computers so that all communication links are monitored. \nAssume that the connections between the computers (i.e., the communication links) are bidirectional. This means that information can flow in both directions across any link. Our goal is to deploy monitoring devices in a way that ensures all communication links are covered by at least one monitoring device. \nProblem: How can we select the minimum number of computers to deploy monitoring devices, such that every communication link is monitored by at least one device? \nCommunication links as follows: : \nServer Goldleaf is connected with Server Windmill, Server Silverstone, Server Sandstorm, Server Amberwave, Server Stormcloud, Server Ironbark, Server Falconeye, Server Glacier, Server Emberlight, Server Frostmoon. \nServer Windmill is connected with Server Firefly, Server Sandstorm, Server Bluebird, Server Ironbark, Server Emberfall, Server Falconeye, Server Emberlight, Server Moonlight. \nServer Silverstone is connected with Server Firefly, Server Blackwood, Server Sandstorm, Server Mirage, Server Stormcloud, Server Glacier, Server Frostmoon. \nServer Firefly is connected with Server Sandstorm, Server Amberwave, Server Bluebird, Server Mirage, Server Ironbark, Server Emberfall, Server Falconeye, Server Stormbreaker, Server Frostmoon, Server Moonlight. \nServer Blackwood is connected with Server Amberwave, Server Ironbark, Server Frostbite, Server Stormbreaker. \nServer Sandstorm is connected with Server Bluebird, Server Thunderstrike, Server Stormcloud, Server Ironbark, Server Falconeye, Server Nightfall, Server Stormbreaker. \nServer Amberwave is connected with Server Thunderstrike, Server Stormcloud, Server Emberfall, Server Nightfall, Server Stormbreaker, Server Glacier. \nServer Bluebird is connected with Server Mirage, Server Thunderstrike, Server Stormcloud, Server Ironbark, Server Emberfall, Server Falconeye, Server Nightfall, Server Glacier. \nServer Mirage is connected with Server Thunderstrike, Server Frostbite. \nServer Thunderstrike is connected with Server Falconeye, Server Nightfall, Server Frostbite, Server Stormbreaker. \nServer Stormcloud is connected with Server Ironbark, Server Emberfall, Server Stormbreaker, Server Moonlight. \nServer Ironbark is connected with Server Emberfall, Server Frostbite, Server Glacier, Server Moonlight. \nServer Emberfall is connected with Server Nightfall, Server Frostbite, Server Glacier, Server Emberlight, Server Moonlight. \nServer Falconeye is connected with Server Nightfall, Server Frostbite, Server Glacier, Server Emberlight, Server Moonlight. \nServer Frostbite is connected with Server Stormbreaker, Server Emberlight. \nServer Glacier is connected with Server Emberlight, Server Moonlight. \n",

  "Q": "Our company has 21 computers connected by several communication links. These computers are named: Server Ravenstone, Server Bluebird, Server Solarflare, Server Stealthwind, Server Willowbrook, Server Thunderstrike, Server Skyhawk, Server Glacierpeak, Server Starfire, Server Frostmoon, Server Amberwave, Server Oceanview, Server Bluewave, Server Nightfall, Server Falconeye, Server Stormcloud, Server Glacier, Server Emberfall, Server Tempest, Server Sandstorm and Server Crimsoncloud. \nTo ensure network security, we need to install monitoring devices (such as firewalls or intrusion detection systems) on some of these computers so that all communication links are monitored. \nAssume that the connections between the computers (i.e., the communication links) are bidirectional. This means that information can flow in both directions across any link. Our goal is to deploy monitoring devices in a way that ensures all communication links are covered by at least one monitoring device. \nProblem: How can we select the minimum number of computers to deploy monitoring devices, such that every communication link is monitored by at least one device? \nCommunication links as follows: : \nServer Ravenstone is connected with Server Stealthwind, Server Thunderstrike, Server Skyhawk, Server Starfire, Server Frostmoon, Server Amberwave, Server Oceanview, Server Nightfall. \nServer Bluebird is connected with Server Skyhawk, Server Starfire, Server Frostmoon, Server Bluewave, Server Nightfall, Server Glacier, Server Emberfall. \nServer Solarflare is connected with Server Willowbrook, Server Glacierpeak, Server Frostmoon, Server Bluewave, Server Falconeye, Server Stormcloud, Server Sandstorm. \nServer Stealthwind is connected with Server Willowbrook, Server Skyhawk, Server Amberwave, Server Oceanview, Server Nightfall, Server Tempest, Server Crimsoncloud. \nServer Willowbrook is connected with Server Thunderstrike, Server Skyhawk, Server Glacierpeak, Server Starfire, Server Frostmoon, Server Amberwave, Server Emberfall, Server Crimsoncloud. \nServer Thunderstrike is connected with Server Skyhawk, Server Frostmoon, Server Amberwave, Server Falconeye, Server Stormcloud, Server Emberfall, Server Sandstorm, Server Crimsoncloud. \nServer Skyhawk is connected with Server Starfire, Server Nightfall, Server Falconeye, Server Emberfall, Server Tempest, Server Sandstorm. \nServer Glacierpeak is connected with Server Frostmoon, Server Glacier, Server Emberfall, Server Tempest, Server Sandstorm, Server Crimsoncloud. \nServer Starfire is connected with Server Frostmoon, Server Oceanview, Server Bluewave, Server Falconeye, Server Stormcloud, Server Emberfall. \nServer Frostmoon is connected with Server Oceanview, Server Falconeye, Server Stormcloud, Server Glacier, Server Crimsoncloud. \nServer Amberwave is connected with Server Sandstorm. \nServer Oceanview is connected with Server Bluewave, Server Nightfall, Server Glacier, Server Tempest. \nServer Bluewave is connected with Server Nightfall, Server Glacier, Server Sandstorm. \nServer Nightfall is connected with Server Emberfall. \nServer Falconeye is connected with Server Stormcloud, Server Glacier, Server Tempest, Server Crimsoncloud. \nServer Stormcloud is connected with Server Emberfall, Server Tempest, Server Crimsoncloud. \nServer Glacier is connected with Server Tempest, Server Crimsoncloud. \nServer Emberfall is connected with Server Sandstorm. \nServer Tempest is connected with Server Sandstorm. \n",

  "Q": "Our company has 21 computers connected by several communication links. These computers are named: Server Blackwood, Server Stormbreaker, Server Firefly, Server Falconeye, Server Nightfall, Server Silverhawk, Server Glacier, Server Bluewave, Server Thunderbolt, Server Sandstorm, Server Redwood, Server Willowbrook, Server Starfire, Server Skyhawk, Server Ironclad, Server Crimsoncloud, Server Ghostwind, Server Ravenstone, Server Emberlight, Server Brightstar and Server Darkhorse. \nTo ensure network security, we need to install monitoring devices (such as firewalls or intrusion detection systems) on some of these computers so that all communication links are monitored. \nAssume that the connections between the computers (i.e., the communication links) are bidirectional. This means that information can flow in both directions across any link. Our goal is to deploy monitoring devices in a way that ensures all communication links are covered by at least one monitoring device. \nProblem: How can we select the minimum number of computers to deploy monitoring devices, such that every communication link is monitored by at least one device? \nCommunication links as follows: : \nServer Blackwood is connected with Server Firefly, Server Silverhawk, Server Glacier, Server Bluewave, Server Sandstorm, Server Redwood, Server Skyhawk, Server Ironclad, Server Crimsoncloud, Server Ravenstone, Server Emberlight, Server Brightstar, Server Darkhorse. \nServer Stormbreaker is connected with Server Firefly, Server Falconeye, Server Glacier, Server Sandstorm, Server Redwood, Server Willowbrook, Server Starfire, Server Ravenstone, Server Emberlight, Server Brightstar. \nServer Firefly is connected with Server Silverhawk, Server Glacier, Server Thunderbolt, Server Sandstorm, Server Willowbrook, Server Starfire, Server Skyhawk, Server Ironclad, Server Crimsoncloud, Server Ghostwind, Server Ravenstone, Server Darkhorse. \nServer Falconeye is connected with Server Glacier, Server Sandstorm, Server Skyhawk, Server Ghostwind, Server Emberlight, Server Darkhorse. \nServer Nightfall is connected with Server Glacier, Server Thunderbolt, Server Sandstorm, Server Willowbrook, Server Starfire, Server Emberlight, Server Brightstar. \nServer Silverhawk is connected with Server Willowbrook, Server Skyhawk, Server Ironclad, Server Ravenstone, Server Emberlight. \nServer Glacier is connected with Server Bluewave, Server Redwood, Server Starfire, Server Skyhawk, Server Crimsoncloud, Server Ghostwind. \nServer Bluewave is connected with Server Thunderbolt, Server Ironclad, Server Ghostwind, Server Ravenstone, Server Brightstar. \nServer Thunderbolt is connected with Server Sandstorm, Server Skyhawk, Server Emberlight, Server Darkhorse. \nServer Sandstorm is connected with Server Starfire, Server Ghostwind, Server Brightstar, Server Darkhorse. \nServer Redwood is connected with Server Starfire, Server Ironclad, Server Crimsoncloud, Server Ghostwind, Server Brightstar. \nServer Willowbrook is connected with Server Ghostwind, Server Darkhorse. \nServer Starfire is connected with Server Crimsoncloud, Server Ravenstone, Server Darkhorse. \nServer Ironclad is connected with Server Darkhorse. \nServer Crimsoncloud is connected with Server Ghostwind, Server Ravenstone, Server Brightstar. \nServer Ghostwind is connected with Server Ravenstone, Server Emberlight. \n",

  "Q": "Our company has 21 computers connected by several communication links. These computers are named: Server Bluewave, Server Glacier, Server Ghostwind, Server Darkhorse, Server Lighthouse, Server Windswept, Server Stealthwind, Server Blackwood, Server Tempest, Server Sandstorm, Server Stormcloud, Server Nightshade, Server Redwood, Server Twilight, Server Goldleaf, Server Stormbreaker, Server Eaglecrest, Server Shadowbrook, Server Emberfall, Server Thunderstrike and Server Seabreeze. \nTo ensure network security, we need to install monitoring devices (such as firewalls or intrusion detection systems) on some of these computers so that all communication links are monitored. \nAssume that the connections between the computers (i.e., the communication links) are bidirectional. This means that information can flow in both directions across any link. Our goal is to deploy monitoring devices in a way that ensures all communication links are covered by at least one monitoring device. \nProblem: How can we select the minimum number of computers to deploy monitoring devices, such that every communication link is monitored by at least one device? \nCommunication links as follows: : \nServer Bluewave is connected with Server Glacier, Server Ghostwind, Server Darkhorse, Server Windswept, Server Blackwood, Server Sandstorm, Server Stormcloud, Server Redwood, Server Eaglecrest, Server Emberfall, Server Thunderstrike, Server Seabreeze. \nServer Glacier is connected with Server Darkhorse, Server Lighthouse, Server Stealthwind, Server Stormcloud, Server Twilight, Server Goldleaf, Server Eaglecrest, Server Emberfall, Server Seabreeze. \nServer Ghostwind is connected with Server Darkhorse, Server Windswept, Server Stealthwind, Server Tempest, Server Sandstorm, Server Stormcloud, Server Redwood, Server Twilight, Server Goldleaf, Server Stormbreaker, Server Eaglecrest, Server Shadowbrook, Server Emberfall, Server Seabreeze. \nServer Darkhorse is connected with Server Sandstorm, Server Nightshade, Server Shadowbrook, Server Thunderstrike. \nServer Lighthouse is connected with Server Windswept, Server Blackwood, Server Redwood, Server Twilight, Server Eaglecrest, Server Emberfall. \nServer Windswept is connected with Server Thunderstrike. \nServer Stealthwind is connected with Server Tempest, Server Nightshade, Server Redwood, Server Goldleaf, Server Stormbreaker, Server Eaglecrest, Server Thunderstrike. \nServer Blackwood is connected with Server Tempest, Server Twilight, Server Stormbreaker, Server Eaglecrest, Server Thunderstrike. \nServer Tempest is connected with Server Redwood, Server Twilight, Server Eaglecrest, Server Shadowbrook, Server Seabreeze. \nServer Sandstorm is connected with Server Stormcloud, Server Goldleaf, Server Eaglecrest, Server Seabreeze. \nServer Stormcloud is connected with Server Nightshade, Server Redwood, Server Goldleaf, Server Eaglecrest, Server Shadowbrook, Server Emberfall, Server Seabreeze. \nServer Nightshade is connected with Server Twilight, Server Eaglecrest, Server Emberfall. \nServer Redwood is connected with Server Twilight, Server Goldleaf, Server Stormbreaker, Server Shadowbrook. \nServer Twilight is connected with Server Emberfall, Server Seabreeze. \nServer Goldleaf is connected with Server Eaglecrest, Server Emberfall, Server Thunderstrike. \nServer Stormbreaker is connected with Server Eaglecrest. \nServer Emberfall is connected with Server Thunderstrike. \n",

  "Q": "Our company has 21 computers connected by several communication links. These computers are named: Server Glacier, Server Eaglecrest, Server Crimsoncloud, Server Firefly, Server Frostmoon, Server Ghostwind, Server Twilight, Server Sunflower, Server Tempest, Server Starfire, Server Redwood, Server Ironbark, Server Stormcloud, Server Willowbrook, Server Sandstorm, Server Goldleaf, Server Ravenstone, Server Silverstone, Server Lighthouse, Server Shadowbrook and Server Firestorm. \nTo ensure network security, we need to install monitoring devices (such as firewalls or intrusion detection systems) on some of these computers so that all communication links are monitored. \nAssume that the connections between the computers (i.e., the communication links) are bidirectional. This means that information can flow in both directions across any link. Our goal is to deploy monitoring devices in a way that ensures all communication links are covered by at least one monitoring device. \nProblem: How can we select the minimum number of computers to deploy monitoring devices, such that every communication link is monitored by at least one device? \nCommunication links as follows: : \nServer Glacier is connected with Server Frostmoon, Server Twilight, Server Sunflower, Server Tempest, Server Willowbrook, Server Goldleaf, Server Ravenstone, Server Silverstone, Server Shadowbrook, Server Firestorm. \nServer Eaglecrest is connected with Server Crimsoncloud, Server Frostmoon, Server Ghostwind, Server Twilight, Server Tempest, Server Ironbark, Server Stormcloud, Server Willowbrook, Server Sandstorm, Server Goldleaf, Server Ravenstone. \nServer Crimsoncloud is connected with Server Frostmoon, Server Ghostwind, Server Tempest, Server Starfire, Server Ironbark, Server Willowbrook, Server Sandstorm, Server Ravenstone, Server Shadowbrook. \nServer Firefly is connected with Server Tempest, Server Starfire, Server Ironbark, Server Stormcloud, Server Ravenstone, Server Lighthouse, Server Shadowbrook, Server Firestorm. \nServer Frostmoon is connected with Server Ghostwind, Server Twilight, Server Sunflower, Server Starfire, Server Ravenstone. \nServer Ghostwind is connected with Server Sunflower, Server Tempest, Server Redwood, Server Ironbark, Server Stormcloud, Server Goldleaf, Server Silverstone, Server Firestorm. \nServer Twilight is connected with Server Sandstorm, Server Ravenstone. \nServer Sunflower is connected with Server Tempest, Server Starfire, Server Redwood, Server Stormcloud, Server Ravenstone. \nServer Tempest is connected with Server Stormcloud, Server Willowbrook, Server Ravenstone, Server Lighthouse, Server Shadowbrook, Server Firestorm. \nServer Starfire is connected with Server Stormcloud, Server Sandstorm, Server Lighthouse, Server Firestorm. \nServer Redwood is connected with Server Willowbrook, Server Ravenstone, Server Lighthouse. \nServer Ironbark is connected with Server Ravenstone, Server Lighthouse, Server Shadowbrook, Server Firestorm. \nServer Stormcloud is connected with Server Sandstorm, Server Goldleaf, Server Ravenstone, Server Firestorm. \nServer Sandstorm is connected with Server Lighthouse. \nServer Goldleaf is connected with Server Ravenstone, Server Shadowbrook, Server Firestorm. \nServer Ravenstone is connected with Server Silverstone, Server Firestorm. \nServer Silverstone is connected with Server Lighthouse, Server Firestorm. \nServer Shadowbrook is connected with Server Firestorm. \n",

  "Q": "Our company has 21 computers connected by several communication links. These computers are named: Server Redwood, Server Frostbite, Server Silverhawk, Server Vortex, Server Sandstorm, Server Stormbreaker, Server Bluebird, Server Amberwave, Server Bluewave, Server Stealthwind, Server Falconeye, Server Nightfall, Server Solarflare, Server Brightstar, Server Firestorm, Server Willowbrook, Server Twilight, Server Glacierpeak, Server Ghostwind, Server Moonlight and Server Emberlight. \nTo ensure network security, we need to install monitoring devices (such as firewalls or intrusion detection systems) on some of these computers so that all communication links are monitored. \nAssume that the connections between the computers (i.e., the communication links) are bidirectional. This means that information can flow in both directions across any link. Our goal is to deploy monitoring devices in a way that ensures all communication links are covered by at least one monitoring device. \nProblem: How can we select the minimum number of computers to deploy monitoring devices, such that every communication link is monitored by at least one device? \nCommunication links as follows: : \nServer Redwood is connected with Server Frostbite, Server Silverhawk, Server Vortex, Server Bluebird, Server Firestorm, Server Glacierpeak, Server Ghostwind, Server Moonlight, Server Emberlight. \nServer Frostbite is connected with Server Bluewave, Server Stealthwind, Server Glacierpeak, Server Ghostwind, Server Emberlight. \nServer Silverhawk is connected with Server Bluebird, Server Amberwave, Server Bluewave, Server Solarflare, Server Firestorm, Server Willowbrook, Server Ghostwind, Server Moonlight. \nServer Vortex is connected with Server Sandstorm, Server Bluebird, Server Stealthwind, Server Nightfall, Server Solarflare, Server Brightstar, Server Ghostwind. \nServer Sandstorm is connected with Server Bluebird, Server Bluewave, Server Nightfall, Server Solarflare, Server Brightstar, Server Twilight, Server Glacierpeak, Server Moonlight, Server Emberlight. \nServer Stormbreaker is connected with Server Bluebird, Server Solarflare, Server Twilight, Server Glacierpeak, Server Ghostwind, Server Moonlight. \nServer Bluebird is connected with Server Brightstar, Server Firestorm, Server Willowbrook, Server Glacierpeak, Server Ghostwind, Server Moonlight. \nServer Amberwave is connected with Server Falconeye, Server Brightstar, Server Firestorm, Server Twilight, Server Glacierpeak, Server Emberlight. \nServer Bluewave is connected with Server Stealthwind, Server Falconeye, Server Nightfall, Server Firestorm, Server Willowbrook, Server Glacierpeak, Server Moonlight. \nServer Stealthwind is connected with Server Solarflare, Server Ghostwind, Server Moonlight, Server Emberlight. \nServer Falconeye is connected with Server Ghostwind, Server Moonlight, Server Emberlight. \nServer Nightfall is connected with Server Brightstar, Server Twilight, Server Ghostwind. \nServer Solarflare is connected with Server Firestorm, Server Moonlight. \nServer Brightstar is connected with Server Twilight, Server Glacierpeak, Server Ghostwind. \nServer Firestorm is connected with Server Glacierpeak. \nServer Willowbrook is connected with Server Twilight, Server Ghostwind, Server Moonlight. \nServer Twilight is connected with Server Glacierpeak, Server Ghostwind, Server Emberlight. \nServer Glacierpeak is connected with Server Moonlight. \nServer Ghostwind is connected with Server Moonlight, Server Emberlight. \n",

  "Q": "Our company has 21 computers connected by several communication links. These computers are named: Server Solarflare, Server Stormbreaker, Server Glacierpeak, Server Stormcloud, Server Ironbark, Server Windswept, Server Oceanview, Server Silverhawk, Server Ironclad, Server Willowbrook, Server Goldleaf, Server Crimsoncloud, Server Nightfall, Server Sandstorm, Server Silverstream, Server Redwood, Server Windmill, Server Amberwave, Server Firestorm, Server Sunflower and Server Ghostwind. \nTo ensure network security, we need to install monitoring devices (such as firewalls or intrusion detection systems) on some of these computers so that all communication links are monitored. \nAssume that the connections between the computers (i.e., the communication links) are bidirectional. This means that information can flow in both directions across any link. Our goal is to deploy monitoring devices in a way that ensures all communication links are covered by at least one monitoring device. \nProblem: How can we select the minimum number of computers to deploy monitoring devices, such that every communication link is monitored by at least one device? \nCommunication links as follows: : \nServer Solarflare is connected with Server Glacierpeak, Server Stormcloud, Server Silverhawk, Server Ironclad, Server Windmill, Server Sunflower. \nServer Stormbreaker is connected with Server Ironbark, Server Windswept, Server Silverhawk, Server Ironclad, Server Crimsoncloud, Server Sunflower, Server Ghostwind. \nServer Glacierpeak is connected with Server Windswept, Server Ironclad, Server Willowbrook, Server Crimsoncloud, Server Silverstream, Server Windmill, Server Amberwave, Server Firestorm, Server Sunflower, Server Ghostwind. \nServer Stormcloud is connected with Server Oceanview, Server Silverhawk, Server Ironclad, Server Sandstorm, Server Redwood, Server Windmill. \nServer Ironbark is connected with Server Oceanview, Server Crimsoncloud, Server Nightfall, Server Amberwave, Server Sunflower, Server Ghostwind. \nServer Windswept is connected with Server Oceanview, Server Silverhawk, Server Goldleaf, Server Crimsoncloud, Server Nightfall, Server Windmill, Server Amberwave. \nServer Oceanview is connected with Server Silverhawk, Server Nightfall, Server Sandstorm, Server Silverstream, Server Windmill, Server Amberwave, Server Firestorm. \nServer Silverhawk is connected with Server Nightfall, Server Silverstream, Server Windmill, Server Firestorm, Server Sunflower. \nServer Ironclad is connected with Server Nightfall, Server Sandstorm, Server Silverstream, Server Windmill, Server Sunflower. \nServer Willowbrook is connected with Server Goldleaf. \nServer Goldleaf is connected with Server Crimsoncloud, Server Nightfall, Server Redwood, Server Amberwave, Server Ghostwind. \nServer Crimsoncloud is connected with Server Sandstorm, Server Windmill, Server Firestorm, Server Sunflower, Server Ghostwind. \nServer Nightfall is connected with Server Redwood, Server Windmill, Server Firestorm, Server Ghostwind. \nServer Sandstorm is connected with Server Redwood, Server Amberwave, Server Sunflower. \nServer Silverstream is connected with Server Sunflower, Server Ghostwind. \nServer Redwood is connected with Server Windmill, Server Amberwave, Server Firestorm. \nServer Windmill is connected with Server Sunflower, Server Ghostwind. \nServer Amberwave is connected with Server Sunflower, Server Ghostwind. \nServer Firestorm is connected with Server Sunflower, Server Ghostwind. \n",

  "Q": "Our company has 21 computers connected by several communication links. These computers are named: Server Twilight, Server Windswept, Server Solarflare, Server Glacier, Server Brightstar, Server Emberfall, Server Stormbreaker, Server Bluebird, Server Emberlight, Server Nightshade, Server Sandstorm, Server Shadowbrook, Server Willowbrook, Server Sunflower, Server Goldleaf, Server Frostbite, Server Thunderbolt, Server Firestorm, Server Crimsoncloud, Server Glacierpeak and Server Ironclad. \nTo ensure network security, we need to install monitoring devices (such as firewalls or intrusion detection systems) on some of these computers so that all communication links are monitored. \nAssume that the connections between the computers (i.e., the communication links) are bidirectional. This means that information can flow in both directions across any link. Our goal is to deploy monitoring devices in a way that ensures all communication links are covered by at least one monitoring device. \nProblem: How can we select the minimum number of computers to deploy monitoring devices, such that every communication link is monitored by at least one device? \nCommunication links as follows: : \nServer Twilight is connected with Server Windswept, Server Brightstar, Server Bluebird, Server Sandstorm, Server Shadowbrook, Server Frostbite, Server Firestorm, Server Crimsoncloud, Server Glacierpeak. \nServer Windswept is connected with Server Glacier, Server Emberfall, Server Bluebird, Server Emberlight, Server Sandstorm, Server Shadowbrook, Server Willowbrook, Server Goldleaf, Server Frostbite, Server Thunderbolt, Server Ironclad. \nServer Solarflare is connected with Server Emberfall, Server Bluebird, Server Emberlight, Server Sandstorm, Server Shadowbrook, Server Sunflower, Server Crimsoncloud. \nServer Glacier is connected with Server Brightstar, Server Bluebird, Server Goldleaf, Server Frostbite. \nServer Brightstar is connected with Server Emberfall, Server Stormbreaker, Server Emberlight, Server Sandstorm, Server Thunderbolt, Server Firestorm. \nServer Emberfall is connected with Server Stormbreaker, Server Bluebird, Server Shadowbrook, Server Frostbite, Server Thunderbolt, Server Firestorm, Server Glacierpeak. \nServer Stormbreaker is connected with Server Emberlight, Server Nightshade, Server Sandstorm, Server Shadowbrook, Server Sunflower, Server Crimsoncloud, Server Glacierpeak, Server Ironclad. \nServer Bluebird is connected with Server Emberlight, Server Goldleaf, Server Frostbite, Server Thunderbolt, Server Crimsoncloud, Server Glacierpeak. \nServer Emberlight is connected with Server Willowbrook, Server Sunflower, Server Thunderbolt, Server Firestorm, Server Glacierpeak, Server Ironclad. \nServer Nightshade is connected with Server Willowbrook, Server Goldleaf, Server Glacierpeak, Server Ironclad. \nServer Sandstorm is connected with Server Willowbrook, Server Goldleaf, Server Frostbite, Server Glacierpeak. \nServer Shadowbrook is connected with Server Willowbrook, Server Sunflower, Server Thunderbolt, Server Glacierpeak. \nServer Willowbrook is connected with Server Thunderbolt, Server Glacierpeak. \nServer Sunflower is connected with Server Goldleaf, Server Firestorm. \nServer Goldleaf is connected with Server Thunderbolt, Server Ironclad. \nServer Frostbite is connected with Server Crimsoncloud, Server Glacierpeak. \nServer Thunderbolt is connected with Server Firestorm, Server Crimsoncloud. \nServer Firestorm is connected with Server Crimsoncloud, Server Glacierpeak. \n",

  "Q": "Our company has 21 computers connected by several communication links. These computers are named: Server Frostbite, Server Skyhawk, Server Ravenstone, Server Darkhorse, Server Eaglecrest, Server Oceanview, Server Lighthouse, Server Goldleaf, Server Ironclad, Server Tempest, Server Twilight, Server Windswept, Server Windmill, Server Nightfall, Server Starfire, Server Crimsoncloud, Server Silverstone, Server Ghostwind, Server Seabreeze, Server Glacierpeak and Server Blackwood. \nTo ensure network security, we need to install monitoring devices (such as firewalls or intrusion detection systems) on some of these computers so that all communication links are monitored. \nAssume that the connections between the computers (i.e., the communication links) are bidirectional. This means that information can flow in both directions across any link. Our goal is to deploy monitoring devices in a way that ensures all communication links are covered by at least one monitoring device. \nProblem: How can we select the minimum number of computers to deploy monitoring devices, such that every communication link is monitored by at least one device? \nCommunication links as follows: : \nServer Frostbite is connected with Server Ravenstone, Server Darkhorse, Server Eaglecrest, Server Oceanview, Server Goldleaf, Server Ironclad, Server Twilight, Server Windswept, Server Nightfall, Server Crimsoncloud. \nServer Skyhawk is connected with Server Ravenstone, Server Darkhorse, Server Lighthouse, Server Tempest, Server Twilight, Server Windmill, Server Starfire, Server Blackwood. \nServer Ravenstone is connected with Server Twilight, Server Windswept, Server Windmill, Server Starfire, Server Seabreeze. \nServer Darkhorse is connected with Server Eaglecrest, Server Goldleaf, Server Twilight, Server Windswept, Server Silverstone, Server Ghostwind, Server Glacierpeak. \nServer Eaglecrest is connected with Server Oceanview, Server Goldleaf, Server Ironclad, Server Tempest, Server Nightfall. \nServer Oceanview is connected with Server Lighthouse, Server Twilight, Server Windmill, Server Nightfall, Server Silverstone, Server Ghostwind, Server Glacierpeak, Server Blackwood. \nServer Lighthouse is connected with Server Ironclad, Server Twilight, Server Starfire, Server Crimsoncloud, Server Silverstone, Server Seabreeze. \nServer Goldleaf is connected with Server Ironclad, Server Tempest, Server Twilight, Server Windmill, Server Nightfall, Server Starfire, Server Blackwood. \nServer Ironclad is connected with Server Tempest, Server Twilight, Server Windswept, Server Windmill, Server Starfire, Server Silverstone. \nServer Tempest is connected with Server Windswept, Server Windmill, Server Starfire, Server Crimsoncloud, Server Ghostwind. \nServer Twilight is connected with Server Starfire, Server Ghostwind, Server Seabreeze, Server Glacierpeak. \nServer Windswept is connected with Server Crimsoncloud, Server Silverstone. \nServer Windmill is connected with Server Crimsoncloud, Server Ghostwind, Server Seabreeze. \nServer Nightfall is connected with Server Seabreeze, Server Blackwood. \nServer Starfire is connected with Server Crimsoncloud, Server Silverstone, Server Seabreeze, Server Glacierpeak, Server Blackwood. \nServer Crimsoncloud is connected with Server Silverstone, Server Seabreeze, Server Glacierpeak. \nServer Silverstone is connected with Server Glacierpeak. \nServer Ghostwind is connected with Server Glacierpeak. \n",

This means that information can flow in both directions across any link. Our goal is to deploy monitoring devices in a way that ensures all communication links are covered by at least one monitoring device. \nProblem: How can we select the minimum number of computers to deploy monitoring devices, such that every communication link is monitored by at least one device? \nCommunication links as follows: : \nServer Silverhawk is connected with Server Emberfall, Server Stormbreaker, Server Glacier, Server Firefly, Server Goldleaf, Server Redwood, Server Oceanview. \nServer Emberfall is connected with Server Brightstar, Server Emberlight, Server Moonlight, Server Nightfall, Server Willowbrook, Server Glacier, Server Firefly, Server Twilight, Server Ghostwind, Server Goldleaf, Server Bluebird, Server Redwood. \nServer Darkhorse is connected with Server Brightstar, Server Glacier, Server Twilight, Server Ghostwind, Server Starfire, Server Bluebird. \nServer Brightstar is connected with Server Emberlight, Server Moonlight, Server Nightfall, Server Glacier, Server Firefly, Server Ghostwind, Server Goldleaf, Server Starfire, Server Bluebird, Server Oceanview. \nServer Emberlight is connected with Server Willowbrook, Server Glacier, Server Ghostwind, Server Redwood, Server Oceanview. \nServer Moonlight is connected with Server Willowbrook, Server Ironbark, Server Twilight, Server Sandstorm, Server Ghostwind, Server Bluebird, Server Oceanview. \nServer Nightfall is connected with Server Willowbrook, Server Ironbark, Server Twilight, Server Sandstorm, Server Starfire, Server Redwood. \nServer Willowbrook is connected with Server Ironbark, Server Twilight, Server Ghostwind, Server Silverstone, Server Starfire, Server Oceanview. \nServer Stormbreaker is connected with Server Glacier, Server Silverstone. \nServer Glacier is connected with Server Firefly, Server Silverstone, Server Starfire, Server Redwood, Server Oceanview. \nServer Ironbark is connected with Server Firefly, Server Twilight, Server Sandstorm, Server Starfire, Server Redwood, Server Oceanview. \nServer Firefly is connected with Server Twilight, Server Starfire, Server Oceanview. \nServer Twilight is connected with Server Sandstorm, Server Silverstone, Server Bluebird. \nServer Sandstorm is connected with Server Ghostwind, Server Silverstone, Server Oceanview. \nServer Ghostwind is connected with Server Silverstone, Server Goldleaf, Server Bluebird. \nServer Silverstone is connected with Server Oceanview. \nServer Goldleaf is connected with Server Oceanview. \nServer Starfire is connected with Server Redwood, Server Oceanview. \n",

This means that information can flow in both directions across any link. Our goal is to deploy monitoring devices in a way that ensures all communication links are covered by at least one monitoring device. \nProblem: How can we select the minimum number of computers to deploy monitoring devices, such that every communication link is monitored by at least one device? \nCommunication links as follows: : \nServer Nightshade is connected with Server Oceanview, Server Silverhawk, Server Thunderstrike, Server Blackwood, Server Frostmoon, Server Ironbark, Server Falconeye, Server Windmill. \nServer Vortex is connected with Server Starfire, Server Windswept, Server Thunderstrike, Server Lighthouse, Server Stealthwind, Server Sunflower, Server Ironclad, Server Windmill. \nServer Starfire is connected with Server Silverhawk, Server Silverstream, Server Ironbark, Server Falconeye, Server Mirage. \nServer Oceanview is connected with Server Silverhawk, Server Thunderstrike, Server Ghostwind, Server Silverstream, Server Ironclad, Server Goldleaf. \nServer Silverhawk is connected with Server Windswept, Server Thunderstrike, Server Blackwood, Server Ironbark, Server Tempest, Server Falconeye, Server Lighthouse, Server Sunflower, Server Mirage. \nServer Windswept is connected with Server Ghostwind, Server Silverstream, Server Frostmoon, Server Ironbark, Server Lighthouse, Server Stealthwind, Server Mirage, Server Windmill. \nServer Thunderstrike is connected with Server Blackwood, Server Mirage, Server Goldleaf, Server Windmill. \nServer Ghostwind is connected with Server Silverstream, Server Blackwood, Server Frostmoon, Server Tempest, Server Falconeye, Server Lighthouse, Server Mirage, Server Goldleaf. \nServer Silverstream is connected with Server Frostmoon, Server Tempest, Server Falconeye, Server Stealthwind. \nServer Blackwood is connected with Server Tempest, Server Ironclad, Server Windmill. \nServer Frostmoon is connected with Server Stealthwind, Server Sunflower, Server Ironclad, Server Goldleaf, Server Windmill. \nServer Ironbark is connected with Server Tempest, Server Goldleaf. \nServer Tempest is connected with Server Falconeye, Server Ironclad. \nServer Falconeye is connected with Server Lighthouse, Server Stealthwind, Server Sunflower, Server Goldleaf. \nServer Lighthouse is connected with Server Sunflower, Server Mirage, Server Ironclad, Server Windmill. \nServer Stealthwind is connected with Server Goldleaf, Server Windmill. \nServer Sunflower is connected with Server Mirage, Server Ironclad, Server Goldleaf. \nServer Mirage is connected with Server Goldleaf, Server Windmill. \nServer Ironclad is connected with Server Windmill. \n",

This means that information can flow in both directions across any link. Our goal is to deploy monitoring devices in a way that ensures all communication links are covered by at least one monitoring device. \nProblem: How can we select the minimum number of computers to deploy monitoring devices, such that every communication link is monitored by at least one device? \nCommunication links as follows: : \nServer Emberlight is connected with Server Firefly, Server Nightfall, Server Sandstorm, Server Firestorm, Server Amberwave, Server Glacierpeak, Server Moonlight. \nServer Bluebird is connected with Server Nightfall, Server Firestorm, Server Lighthouse, Server Ghostwind, Server Blackwood, Server Goldleaf, Server Frostbite, Server Eaglecrest. \nServer Firefly is connected with Server Nightfall, Server Sandstorm, Server Lighthouse, Server Ghostwind, Server Goldleaf, Server Stealthwind, Server Eaglecrest, Server Solarflare. \nServer Nightfall is connected with Server Ironclad, Server Ghostwind, Server Blackwood, Server Goldleaf, Server Frostbite, Server Bluewave, Server Amberwave, Server Solarflare. \nServer Ironclad is connected with Server Sandstorm, Server Amberwave, Server Moonlight, Server Solarflare, Server Oceanview. \nServer Sandstorm is connected with Server Firestorm, Server Ghostwind, Server Twilight, Server Stealthwind, Server Eaglecrest, Server Moonlight, Server Solarflare. \nServer Firestorm is connected with Server Lighthouse, Server Stealthwind, Server Frostbite, Server Amberwave, Server Oceanview. \nServer Lighthouse is connected with Server Blackwood, Server Goldleaf, Server Stealthwind. \nServer Ghostwind is connected with Server Goldleaf, Server Twilight, Server Bluewave, Server Amberwave, Server Oceanview. \nServer Blackwood is connected with Server Goldleaf, Server Frostbite, Server Amberwave, Server Glacierpeak, Server Solarflare. \nServer Goldleaf is connected with Server Twilight, Server Frostbite, Server Bluewave, Server Moonlight, Server Oceanview. \nServer Twilight is connected with Server Frostbite, Server Amberwave, Server Eaglecrest, Server Glacierpeak. \nServer Stealthwind is connected with Server Frostbite, Server Amberwave, Server Eaglecrest, Server Solarflare. \nServer Frostbite is connected with Server Bluewave, Server Solarflare, Server Oceanview. \nServer Bluewave is connected with Server Amberwave, Server Eaglecrest, Server Glacierpeak, Server Moonlight, Server Solarflare, Server Oceanview. \nServer Amberwave is connected with Server Moonlight, Server Oceanview. \nServer Eaglecrest is connected with Server Glacierpeak, Server Moonlight. \nServer Moonlight is connected with Server Solarflare. \n",

These computers are named: Server Ironbark, Server Goldleaf, Server Oceanview, Server Tempest, Server Sunflower, Server Silverhawk, Server Firefly, Server Eaglecrest, Server Redwood, Server Solarflare, Server Starfire, Server Moonlight, Server Skyhawk, Server Mirage, Server Firestorm, Server Shadowbrook, Server Frostbite, Server Silverstone, Server Frostmoon, Server Amberwave and Server Vortex. \nTo ensure network security, we need to install monitoring devices (such as firewalls or intrusion detection systems) on some of these computers so that all communication links are monitored. \nAssume that the connections between the computers (i.e., the communication links) are bidirectional. This means that information can flow in both directions across any link. Our goal is to deploy monitoring devices in a way that ensures all communication links are covered by at least one monitoring device. \nProblem: How can we select the minimum number of computers to deploy monitoring devices, such that every communication link is monitored by at least one device? \nCommunication links as follows: : \nServer Ironbark is connected with Server Goldleaf, Server Tempest, Server Silverhawk, Server Firefly, Server Redwood, Server Moonlight, Server Skyhawk, Server Mirage, Server Firestorm, Server Shadowbrook, Server Frostbite, Server Vortex. \nServer Goldleaf is connected with Server Oceanview, Server Tempest, Server Silverhawk, Server Mirage, Server Firestorm, Server Frostbite, Server Silverstone, Server Frostmoon. \nServer Oceanview is connected with Server Tempest, Server Eaglecrest, Server Redwood, Server Starfire, Server Moonlight, Server Skyhawk, Server Mirage, Server Frostmoon, Server Amberwave, Server Vortex. \nServer Tempest is connected with Server Sunflower, Server Silverhawk, Server Firefly, Server Eaglecrest, Server Redwood, Server Solarflare, Server Starfire, Server Frostbite, Server Amberwave, Server Vortex. \nServer Sunflower is connected with Server Silverhawk, Server Firefly, Server Solarflare, Server Moonlight, Server Skyhawk, Server Frostbite, Server Silverstone. \nServer Silverhawk is connected with Server Skyhawk, Server Mirage, Server Frostbite, Server Silverstone, Server Frostmoon, Server Amberwave. \nServer Firefly is connected with Server Eaglecrest, Server Frostbite, Server Vortex. \nServer Eaglecrest is connected with Server Solarflare, Server Moonlight, Server Mirage, Server Shadowbrook, Server Frostbite. \nServer Redwood is connected with Server Moonlight, Server Mirage, Server Firestorm, Server Silverstone, Server Frostmoon, Server Amberwave. \nServer Solarflare is connected with Server Starfire. \nServer Starfire is connected with Server Moonlight, Server Shadowbrook, Server Frostbite, Server Silverstone. \nServer Moonlight is connected with Server Skyhawk, Server Mirage, Server Frostbite, Server Silverstone, Server Frostmoon, Server Amberwave. \nServer Skyhawk is connected with Server Frostbite, Server Amberwave, Server Vortex. \nServer Mirage is connected with Server Shadowbrook. \nServer Firestorm is connected with Server Frostbite, Server Frostmoon. \nServer Shadowbrook is connected with Server Silverstone. \nServer Frostbite is connected with Server Amberwave. \nServer Silverstone is connected with Server Frostmoon. \nServer Amberwave is connected with Server Vortex. \n",
