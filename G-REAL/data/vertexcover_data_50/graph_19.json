These computers are named: Server Thunderstrike, Server Bluebird, Server Seabreeze, Server Redwood, Server Windmill, Server Firestorm, Server Firefly, Server Oceanview, Server Thunderbolt, Server Stealthwind, Server Twilight, Server Blackwood, Server Moonlight, Server Goldleaf, Server Amberwave, Server Brightstar, Server Bluewave, Server Skyhawk and Server Emberfall. \nTo ensure network security, we need to install monitoring devices (such as firewalls or intrusion detection systems) on some of these computers so that all communication links are monitored. \nAssume that the connections between the computers (i.e., the communication links) are bidirectional. This means that information can flow in both directions across any link. Our goal is to deploy monitoring devices in a way that ensures all communication links are covered by at least one monitoring device. \nProblem: How can we select the minimum number of computers to deploy monitoring devices, such that every communication link is monitored by at least one device? \nCommunication links as follows: : \nServer Thunderstrike is connected with Server Seabreeze, Server Windmill, Server Firestorm, Server Oceanview, Server Thunderbolt, Server Twilight, Server Goldleaf, Server Brightstar, Server Skyhawk. \nServer Bluebird is connected with Server Firestorm, Server Thunderbolt, Server Goldleaf, Server Bluewave, Server Skyhawk. \nServer Seabreeze is connected with Server Redwood, Server Firefly, Server Blackwood, Server Moonlight, Server Goldleaf, Server Bluewave. \nServer Redwood is connected with Server Firefly, Server Thunderbolt, Server Stealthwind, Server Twilight, Server Moonlight, Server Goldleaf, Server Amberwave, Server Brightstar, Server Skyhawk, Server Emberfall. \nServer Windmill is connected with Server Firestorm, Server Oceanview, Server Thunderbolt, Server Stealthwind, Server Moonlight, Server Brightstar, Server Bluewave. \nServer Firestorm is connected with Server Blackwood, Server Moonlight, Server Amberwave, Server Brightstar, Server Bluewave, Server Emberfall. \nServer Firefly is connected with Server Oceanview, Server Stealthwind, Server Blackwood, Server Moonlight, Server Brightstar, Server Skyhawk. \nServer Oceanview is connected with Server Thunderbolt, Server Twilight, Server Blackwood, Server Amberwave, Server Emberfall. \nServer Thunderbolt is connected with Server Twilight, Server Blackwood, Server Goldleaf, Server Amberwave, Server Emberfall. \nServer Stealthwind is connected with Server Moonlight, Server Brightstar. \nServer Twilight is connected with Server Amberwave, Server Bluewave. \nServer Blackwood is connected with Server Moonlight, Server Amberwave. \nServer Moonlight is connected with Server Goldleaf, Server Amberwave, Server Brightstar, Server Emberfall. \nServer Amberwave is connected with Server Bluewave. \nServer Brightstar is connected with Server Skyhawk. \nServer Bluewave is connected with Server Skyhawk. \n",

  "Q": "Our company has 19 computers connected by several communication links. These computers are named: Server Sunflower, Server Solarflare, Server Frostmoon, Server Firefly, Server Nightshade, Server Glacierpeak, Server Emberlight, Server Silverstream, Server Frostbite, Server Silverstone, Server Bluebird, Server Bluewave, Server Darkhorse, Server Brightstar, Server Nightfall, Server Sandstorm, Server Falconeye, Server Ravenstone and Server Seabreeze. \nTo ensure network security, we need to install monitoring devices (such as firewalls or intrusion detection systems) on some of these computers so that all communication links are monitored. \nAssume that the connections between the computers (i.e., the communication links) are bidirectional. This means that information can flow in both directions across any link. Our goal is to deploy monitoring devices in a way that ensures all communication links are covered by at least one monitoring device. \nProblem: How can we select the minimum number of computers to deploy monitoring devices, such that every communication link is monitored by at least one device? \nCommunication links as follows: : \nServer Sunflower is connected with Server Firefly, Server Glacierpeak, Server Silverstream, Server Frostbite, Server Silverstone, Server Bluebird, Server Bluewave, Server Nightfall, Server Ravenstone, Server Seabreeze. \nServer Solarflare is connected with Server Frostbite, Server Silverstone, Server Darkhorse, Server Brightstar, Server Sandstorm. \nServer Frostmoon is connected with Server Firefly, Server Emberlight, Server Silverstream, Server Bluebird, Server Bluewave, Server Darkhorse, Server Brightstar, Server Nightfall, Server Sandstorm, Server Ravenstone. \nServer Firefly is connected with Server Frostbite, Server Bluebird, Server Darkhorse, Server Brightstar, Server Nightfall, Server Sandstorm, Server Falconeye, Server Ravenstone. \nServer Nightshade is connected with Server Glacierpeak, Server Emberlight, Server Silverstone, Server Darkhorse, Server Brightstar, Server Nightfall, Server Sandstorm, Server Falconeye. \nServer Glacierpeak is connected with Server Emberlight, Server Silverstream, Server Bluebird, Server Bluewave, Server Falconeye, Server Ravenstone, Server Seabreeze. \nServer Emberlight is connected with Server Nightfall, Server Sandstorm, Server Falconeye, Server Seabreeze. \nServer Silverstream is connected with Server Bluewave, Server Sandstorm, Server Falconeye. \nServer Frostbite is connected with Server Sandstorm, Server Ravenstone. \nServer Bluebird is connected with Server Bluewave, Server Falconeye. \nServer Bluewave is connected with Server Darkhorse, Server Falconeye, Server Seabreeze. \nServer Darkhorse is connected with Server Brightstar, Server Nightfall. \nServer Brightstar is connected with Server Nightfall, Server Falconeye. \nServer Nightfall is connected with Server Sandstorm, Server Falconeye. \nServer Sandstorm is connected with Server Seabreeze. \nServer Falconeye is connected with Server Ravenstone, Server Seabreeze. \nServer Ravenstone is connected with Server Seabreeze. \n",

This means that information can flow in both directions across any link. Our goal is to deploy monitoring devices in a way that ensures all communication links are covered by at least one monitoring device. \nProblem: How can we select the minimum number of computers to deploy monitoring devices, such that every communication link is monitored by at least one device? \nCommunication links as follows: : \nServer Firefly is connected with Server Oceanview, Server Goldleaf, Server Silverhawk, Server Tempest, Server Willowbrook, Server Emberlight, Server Thunderbolt. \nServer Oceanview is connected with Server Emberfall, Server Tempest, Server Silverstream, Server Solarflare, Server Thunderbolt, Server Mirage, Server Blackwood, Server Windswept. \nServer Goldleaf is connected with Server Tempest, Server Ghostwind, Server Willowbrook, Server Thunderbolt, Server Windswept. \nServer Darkhorse is connected with Server Emberfall, Server Silverhawk, Server Ghostwind, Server Willowbrook, Server Mirage, Server Blackwood, Server Eaglecrest. \nServer Emberfall is connected with Server Silverhawk, Server Tempest, Server Silverstream, Server Ghostwind, Server Vortex, Server Mirage, Server Blackwood, Server Stormcloud. \nServer Silverhawk is connected with Server Willowbrook, Server Mirage, Server Windswept. \nServer Tempest is connected with Server Ghostwind, Server Solarflare, Server Vortex, Server Thunderbolt, Server Stormcloud. \nServer Silverstream is connected with Server Solarflare, Server Vortex, Server Emberlight, Server Thunderbolt, Server Eaglecrest, Server Windswept. \nServer Ghostwind is connected with Server Solarflare, Server Willowbrook, Server Mirage, Server Blackwood, Server Stormcloud, Server Eaglecrest. \nServer Solarflare is connected with Server Willowbrook, Server Emberlight, Server Eaglecrest, Server Windswept. \nServer Willowbrook is connected with Server Vortex, Server Stormcloud. \nServer Vortex is connected with Server Emberlight, Server Blackwood, Server Eaglecrest. \nServer Emberlight is connected with Server Blackwood, Server Eaglecrest, Server Windswept. \nServer Thunderbolt is connected with Server Blackwood, Server Stormcloud. \nServer Mirage is connected with Server Eaglecrest, Server Windswept. \nServer Stormcloud is connected with Server Windswept. \n",

This means that information can flow in both directions across any link. Our goal is to deploy monitoring devices in a way that ensures all communication links are covered by at least one monitoring device. \nProblem: How can we select the minimum number of computers to deploy monitoring devices, such that every communication link is monitored by at least one device? \nCommunication links as follows: : \nServer Silverstone is connected with Server Ironclad, Server Blackwood, Server Bluebird, Server Frostmoon, Server Shadowbrook, Server Glacierpeak, Server Silverstream. \nServer Ironclad is connected with Server Redwood, Server Blackwood, Server Crimsoncloud, Server Moonlight, Server Bluewave. \nServer Redwood is connected with Server Firefly, Server Bluebird, Server Willowbrook, Server Skyhawk, Server Glacierpeak, Server Bluewave, Server Silverstream. \nServer Firefly is connected with Server Blackwood, Server Bluebird, Server Frostmoon, Server Glacierpeak, Server Sandstorm. \nServer Solarflare is connected with Server Crimsoncloud, Server Bluebird, Server Willowbrook, Server Glacierpeak, Server Bluewave, Server Tempest, Server Sandstorm. \nServer Blackwood is connected with Server Bluebird, Server Willowbrook, Server Moonlight, Server Frostmoon, Server Glacier, Server Tempest. \nServer Crimsoncloud is connected with Server Skyhawk, Server Frostmoon, Server Bluewave, Server Silverstream. \nServer Bluebird is connected with Server Willowbrook, Server Moonlight, Server Frostmoon, Server Glacier, Server Glacierpeak, Server Tempest, Server Sandstorm. \nServer Willowbrook is connected with Server Glacier, Server Shadowbrook, Server Bluewave, Server Sandstorm. \nServer Skyhawk is connected with Server Frostmoon, Server Glacier, Server Shadowbrook, Server Glacierpeak, Server Bluewave, Server Silverstream, Server Sandstorm. \nServer Frostmoon is connected with Server Glacierpeak, Server Bluewave, Server Sandstorm. \nServer Glacier is connected with Server Shadowbrook, Server Silverstream, Server Sandstorm. \nServer Shadowbrook is connected with Server Bluewave, Server Sandstorm. \nServer Glacierpeak is connected with Server Tempest, Server Silverstream, Server Sandstorm. \nServer Bluewave is connected with Server Silverstream. \nServer Silverstream is connected with Server Sandstorm. \n",

  "Q": "Our company has 19 computers connected by several communication links. These computers are named: Server Shadowbrook, Server Sandstorm, Server Ravenstone, Server Starfire, Server Willowbrook, Server Firefly, Server Brightstar, Server Darkhorse, Server Emberfall, Server Seabreeze, Server Stormcloud, Server Solarflare, Server Blackwood, Server Nightshade, Server Sunflower, Server Ironbark, Server Amberwave, Server Twilight and Server Redwood. \nTo ensure network security, we need to install monitoring devices (such as firewalls or intrusion detection systems) on some of these computers so that all communication links are monitored. \nAssume that the connections between the computers (i.e., the communication links) are bidirectional. This means that information can flow in both directions across any link. Our goal is to deploy monitoring devices in a way that ensures all communication links are covered by at least one monitoring device. \nProblem: How can we select the minimum number of computers to deploy monitoring devices, such that every communication link is monitored by at least one device? \nCommunication links as follows: : \nServer Shadowbrook is connected with Server Ravenstone, Server Brightstar, Server Darkhorse, Server Stormcloud, Server Solarflare, Server Blackwood, Server Nightshade, Server Twilight, Server Redwood. \nServer Sandstorm is connected with Server Starfire, Server Firefly, Server Brightstar, Server Darkhorse, Server Seabreeze, Server Solarflare, Server Blackwood, Server Nightshade, Server Twilight, Server Redwood. \nServer Ravenstone is connected with Server Willowbrook, Server Brightstar, Server Emberfall, Server Blackwood, Server Sunflower, Server Amberwave, Server Redwood. \nServer Starfire is connected with Server Firefly, Server Brightstar, Server Darkhorse, Server Blackwood, Server Nightshade, Server Sunflower, Server Ironbark, Server Amberwave, Server Redwood. \nServer Willowbrook is connected with Server Darkhorse, Server Seabreeze, Server Solarflare, Server Blackwood, Server Sunflower, Server Amberwave, Server Twilight, Server Redwood. \nServer Firefly is connected with Server Seabreeze, Server Ironbark, Server Amberwave, Server Twilight. \nServer Brightstar is connected with Server Darkhorse, Server Stormcloud, Server Nightshade, Server Sunflower, Server Amberwave. \nServer Darkhorse is connected with Server Emberfall, Server Seabreeze, Server Stormcloud, Server Nightshade, Server Ironbark. \nServer Emberfall is connected with Server Solarflare, Server Ironbark, Server Amberwave, Server Redwood. \nServer Seabreeze is connected with Server Stormcloud, Server Sunflower, Server Ironbark. \nServer Stormcloud is connected with Server Solarflare, Server Sunflower, Server Twilight. \nServer Blackwood is connected with Server Nightshade. \nServer Sunflower is connected with Server Ironbark. \nServer Ironbark is connected with Server Amberwave. \nServer Amberwave is connected with Server Redwood. \nServer Twilight is connected with Server Redwood. \n",
