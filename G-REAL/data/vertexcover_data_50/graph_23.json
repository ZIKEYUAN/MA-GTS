  "Q": "Our company has 23 computers connected by several communication links. These computers are named: Server Silverstream, Server Firefly, Server Brightstar, Server Amberwave, Server Solarflare, Server Tempest, Server Frostbite, Server Ironbark, Server Glacierpeak, Server Emberfall, Server Moonlight, Server Frostmoon, Server Shadowbrook, Server Sandstorm, Server Stormbreaker, Server Ironclad, Server Oceanview, Server Thunderbolt, Server Crimsoncloud, Server Willowbrook, Server Stealthwind, Server Sunflower and Server Falconeye. \nTo ensure network security, we need to install monitoring devices (such as firewalls or intrusion detection systems) on some of these computers so that all communication links are monitored. \nAssume that the connections between the computers (i.e., the communication links) are bidirectional. This means that information can flow in both directions across any link. Our goal is to deploy monitoring devices in a way that ensures all communication links are covered by at least one monitoring device. \nProblem: How can we select the minimum number of computers to deploy monitoring devices, such that every communication link is monitored by at least one device? \nCommunication links as follows: : \nServer Silverstream is connected with Server Firefly, Server Brightstar, Server Amberwave, Server Solarflare, Server Frostbite, Server Moonlight, Server Frostmoon, Server Sandstorm, Server Ironclad, Server Oceanview, Server Crimsoncloud, Server Willowbrook, Server Sunflower. \nServer Firefly is connected with Server Frostbite, Server Emberfall, Server Crimsoncloud, Server Stealthwind. \nServer Brightstar is connected with Server Amberwave, Server Glacierpeak, Server Shadowbrook, Server Sandstorm, Server Ironclad, Server Oceanview, Server Sunflower. \nServer Amberwave is connected with Server Tempest, Server Ironbark, Server Moonlight. \nServer Solarflare is connected with Server Tempest, Server Ironbark, Server Glacierpeak, Server Sandstorm, Server Stormbreaker, Server Thunderbolt, Server Stealthwind. \nServer Tempest is connected with Server Glacierpeak, Server Emberfall, Server Moonlight, Server Sandstorm, Server Stormbreaker, Server Oceanview, Server Crimsoncloud, Server Falconeye. \nServer Frostbite is connected with Server Emberfall, Server Frostmoon, Server Shadowbrook, Server Stormbreaker, Server Oceanview, Server Thunderbolt, Server Willowbrook, Server Stealthwind, Server Falconeye. \nServer Ironbark is connected with Server Glacierpeak, Server Frostmoon, Server Stormbreaker, Server Ironclad, Server Oceanview, Server Thunderbolt. \nServer Glacierpeak is connected with Server Emberfall, Server Moonlight, Server Frostmoon, Server Stormbreaker, Server Sunflower. \nServer Emberfall is connected with Server Moonlight, Server Frostmoon, Server Sandstorm, Server Stormbreaker, Server Stealthwind. \nServer Moonlight is connected with Server Sandstorm, Server Oceanview, Server Thunderbolt, Server Crimsoncloud, Server Falconeye. \nServer Frostmoon is connected with Server Ironclad, Server Oceanview, Server Stealthwind, Server Falconeye. \nServer Shadowbrook is connected with Server Stormbreaker, Server Thunderbolt, Server Willowbrook, Server Sunflower, Server Falconeye. \nServer Sandstorm is connected with Server Stormbreaker, Server Thunderbolt, Server Stealthwind, Server Sunflower. \nServer Stormbreaker is connected with Server Ironclad, Server Thunderbolt, Server Crimsoncloud, Server Stealthwind, Server Sunflower, Server Falconeye. \nServer Ironclad is connected with Server Thunderbolt, Server Stealthwind, Server Falconeye. \nServer Oceanview is connected with Server Willowbrook, Server Stealthwind, Server Sunflower. \nServer Thunderbolt is connected with Server Stealthwind. \nServer Crimsoncloud is connected with Server Willowbrook, Server Stealthwind, Server Sunflower, Server Falconeye. \nServer Willowbrook is connected with Server Falconeye. \nServer Stealthwind is connected with Server Sunflower, Server Falconeye. \n",

  "Q": "Our company has 23 computers connected by several communication links. These computers are named: Server Starfire, Server Glacierpeak, Server Silverhawk, Server Stormcloud, Server Ironbark, Server Firefly, Server Emberlight, Server Silverstone, Server Silverstream, Server Mirage, Server Bluewave, Server Ironclad, Server Shadowbrook, Server Eaglecrest, Server Oceanview, Server Brightstar, Server Thunderstrike, Server Falconeye, Server Bluebird, Server Ravenstone, Server Moonlight, Server Glacier and Server Solarflare. \nTo ensure network security, we need to install monitoring devices (such as firewalls or intrusion detection systems) on some of these computers so that all communication links are monitored. \nAssume that the connections between the computers (i.e., the communication links) are bidirectional. This means that information can flow in both directions across any link. Our goal is to deploy monitoring devices in a way that ensures all communication links are covered by at least one monitoring device. \nProblem: How can we select the minimum number of computers to deploy monitoring devices, such that every communication link is monitored by at least one device? \nCommunication links as follows: : \nServer Starfire is connected with Server Glacierpeak, Server Stormcloud, Server Emberlight, Server Silverstone, Server Silverstream, Server Ironclad, Server Oceanview, Server Thunderstrike, Server Falconeye, Server Bluebird, Server Moonlight. \nServer Glacierpeak is connected with Server Firefly, Server Ironclad, Server Eaglecrest, Server Brightstar, Server Thunderstrike, Server Bluebird, Server Moonlight, Server Glacier, Server Solarflare. \nServer Silverhawk is connected with Server Ironbark, Server Silverstone, Server Bluewave, Server Shadowbrook, Server Eaglecrest, Server Oceanview, Server Falconeye, Server Ravenstone. \nServer Stormcloud is connected with Server Ironbark, Server Firefly, Server Silverstream, Server Mirage, Server Ironclad, Server Shadowbrook, Server Eaglecrest, Server Oceanview, Server Thunderstrike, Server Ravenstone, Server Solarflare. \nServer Ironbark is connected with Server Firefly, Server Silverstone, Server Mirage, Server Bluewave, Server Ironclad, Server Shadowbrook, Server Eaglecrest, Server Falconeye, Server Bluebird, Server Solarflare. \nServer Firefly is connected with Server Emberlight, Server Bluewave, Server Ironclad, Server Eaglecrest, Server Brightstar, Server Thunderstrike, Server Bluebird. \nServer Emberlight is connected with Server Brightstar, Server Falconeye, Server Moonlight, Server Glacier, Server Solarflare. \nServer Silverstone is connected with Server Silverstream, Server Mirage, Server Ironclad, Server Shadowbrook. \nServer Silverstream is connected with Server Bluewave, Server Ironclad, Server Falconeye, Server Bluebird, Server Moonlight, Server Glacier. \nServer Mirage is connected with Server Ironclad, Server Thunderstrike, Server Glacier, Server Solarflare. \nServer Bluewave is connected with Server Ironclad, Server Eaglecrest, Server Brightstar, Server Falconeye, Server Glacier, Server Solarflare. \nServer Ironclad is connected with Server Oceanview, Server Thunderstrike, Server Bluebird, Server Moonlight. \nServer Shadowbrook is connected with Server Eaglecrest, Server Brightstar. \nServer Eaglecrest is connected with Server Oceanview, Server Moonlight, Server Glacier, Server Solarflare. \nServer Oceanview is connected with Server Thunderstrike, Server Ravenstone, Server Glacier, Server Solarflare. \nServer Brightstar is connected with Server Thunderstrike, Server Falconeye, Server Ravenstone, Server Solarflare. \nServer Thunderstrike is connected with Server Falconeye, Server Solarflare. \nServer Falconeye is connected with Server Solarflare. \nServer Bluebird is connected with Server Glacier. \nServer Ravenstone is connected with Server Moonlight, Server Solarflare. \n",

  "Q": "Our company has 23 computers connected by several communication links. These computers are named: Server Windmill, Server Silverhawk, Server Bluebird, Server Skyhawk, Server Stormbreaker, Server Willowbrook, Server Windswept, Server Sunflower, Server Frostmoon, Server Seabreeze, Server Amberwave, Server Oceanview, Server Stormcloud, Server Nightshade, Server Glacier, Server Goldleaf, Server Emberfall, Server Emberlight, Server Crimsoncloud, Server Tempest, Server Nightfall, Server Glacierpeak and Server Silverstream. \nTo ensure network security, we need to install monitoring devices (such as firewalls or intrusion detection systems) on some of these computers so that all communication links are monitored. \nAssume that the connections between the computers (i.e., the communication links) are bidirectional. This means that information can flow in both directions across any link. Our goal is to deploy monitoring devices in a way that ensures all communication links are covered by at least one monitoring device. \nProblem: How can we select the minimum number of computers to deploy monitoring devices, such that every communication link is monitored by at least one device? \nCommunication links as follows: : \nServer Windmill is connected with Server Willowbrook, Server Frostmoon, Server Seabreeze, Server Amberwave, Server Nightshade, Server Goldleaf, Server Crimsoncloud, Server Silverstream. \nServer Silverhawk is connected with Server Bluebird, Server Willowbrook, Server Sunflower, Server Frostmoon, Server Seabreeze, Server Stormcloud, Server Goldleaf, Server Emberlight, Server Tempest, Server Nightfall, Server Glacierpeak. \nServer Bluebird is connected with Server Willowbrook, Server Sunflower, Server Seabreeze, Server Amberwave, Server Crimsoncloud, Server Tempest, Server Nightfall, Server Glacierpeak. \nServer Skyhawk is connected with Server Windswept, Server Sunflower, Server Seabreeze, Server Oceanview, Server Nightshade, Server Glacierpeak, Server Silverstream. \nServer Stormbreaker is connected with Server Willowbrook, Server Sunflower, Server Amberwave, Server Oceanview, Server Stormcloud, Server Emberlight, Server Crimsoncloud, Server Glacierpeak. \nServer Willowbrook is connected with Server Frostmoon, Server Stormcloud, Server Glacier, Server Goldleaf, Server Emberlight, Server Nightfall, Server Glacierpeak, Server Silverstream. \nServer Windswept is connected with Server Sunflower, Server Glacier, Server Goldleaf, Server Crimsoncloud, Server Tempest, Server Glacierpeak. \nServer Sunflower is connected with Server Oceanview, Server Glacier, Server Goldleaf, Server Emberfall, Server Crimsoncloud, Server Glacierpeak. \nServer Frostmoon is connected with Server Seabreeze, Server Amberwave, Server Stormcloud, Server Emberlight, Server Glacierpeak. \nServer Seabreeze is connected with Server Oceanview, Server Nightshade, Server Tempest, Server Nightfall. \nServer Amberwave is connected with Server Nightshade, Server Glacier, Server Goldleaf, Server Emberfall, Server Tempest, Server Nightfall, Server Silverstream. \nServer Oceanview is connected with Server Stormcloud, Server Nightshade, Server Glacier, Server Goldleaf. \nServer Stormcloud is connected with Server Nightshade, Server Tempest, Server Glacierpeak, Server Silverstream. \nServer Nightshade is connected with Server Glacier, Server Nightfall. \nServer Glacier is connected with Server Emberfall, Server Tempest, Server Glacierpeak. \nServer Goldleaf is connected with Server Emberfall, Server Emberlight, Server Crimsoncloud, Server Tempest, Server Glacierpeak. \nServer Emberfall is connected with Server Crimsoncloud, Server Tempest. \nServer Emberlight is connected with Server Tempest, Server Nightfall. \nServer Crimsoncloud is connected with Server Nightfall, Server Silverstream. \nServer Tempest is connected with Server Silverstream. \nServer Nightfall is connected with Server Glacierpeak, Server Silverstream. \n",

  "Q": "Our company has 23 computers connected by several communication links. These computers are named: Server Emberfall, Server Goldleaf, Server Sandstorm, Server Thunderbolt, Server Ironclad, Server Bluewave, Server Lighthouse, Server Redwood, Server Silverhawk, Server Stealthwind, Server Stormbreaker, Server Windswept, Server Firefly, Server Twilight, Server Blackwood, Server Bluebird, Server Brightstar, Server Emberlight, Server Ghostwind, Server Nightfall, Server Darkhorse, Server Frostmoon and Server Glacier. \nTo ensure network security, we need to install monitoring devices (such as firewalls or intrusion detection systems) on some of these computers so that all communication links are monitored. \nAssume that the connections between the computers (i.e., the communication links) are bidirectional. This means that information can flow in both directions across any link. Our goal is to deploy monitoring devices in a way that ensures all communication links are covered by at least one monitoring device. \nProblem: How can we select the minimum number of computers to deploy monitoring devices, such that every communication link is monitored by at least one device? \nCommunication links as follows: : \nServer Emberfall is connected with Server Goldleaf, Server Bluewave, Server Lighthouse, Server Silverhawk, Server Stormbreaker, Server Windswept, Server Twilight, Server Emberlight, Server Darkhorse, Server Frostmoon. \nServer Goldleaf is connected with Server Thunderbolt, Server Bluewave, Server Redwood, Server Windswept, Server Firefly, Server Ghostwind, Server Glacier. \nServer Sandstorm is connected with Server Ironclad, Server Bluewave, Server Lighthouse, Server Redwood, Server Stealthwind, Server Windswept, Server Twilight, Server Bluebird, Server Brightstar, Server Emberlight, Server Darkhorse, Server Glacier. \nServer Thunderbolt is connected with Server Ironclad, Server Redwood, Server Silverhawk, Server Stealthwind, Server Windswept, Server Twilight, Server Blackwood, Server Bluebird, Server Brightstar, Server Emberlight, Server Nightfall, Server Frostmoon, Server Glacier. \nServer Ironclad is connected with Server Bluewave, Server Redwood, Server Stormbreaker, Server Firefly, Server Twilight, Server Bluebird, Server Brightstar, Server Emberlight, Server Glacier. \nServer Bluewave is connected with Server Redwood, Server Stealthwind, Server Bluebird, Server Nightfall, Server Darkhorse, Server Glacier. \nServer Lighthouse is connected with Server Bluebird, Server Brightstar, Server Emberlight, Server Darkhorse, Server Glacier. \nServer Redwood is connected with Server Windswept, Server Blackwood, Server Brightstar. \nServer Silverhawk is connected with Server Twilight, Server Blackwood, Server Ghostwind, Server Darkhorse, Server Frostmoon. \nServer Stealthwind is connected with Server Stormbreaker, Server Windswept, Server Emberlight, Server Glacier. \nServer Stormbreaker is connected with Server Blackwood, Server Nightfall, Server Glacier. \nServer Windswept is connected with Server Firefly, Server Bluebird, Server Nightfall, Server Darkhorse, Server Frostmoon, Server Glacier. \nServer Firefly is connected with Server Emberlight. \nServer Twilight is connected with Server Ghostwind, Server Nightfall, Server Frostmoon. \nServer Blackwood is connected with Server Brightstar, Server Emberlight, Server Darkhorse. \nServer Bluebird is connected with Server Emberlight, Server Darkhorse. \nServer Brightstar is connected with Server Emberlight, Server Nightfall, Server Darkhorse, Server Glacier. \nServer Emberlight is connected with Server Ghostwind, Server Frostmoon, Server Glacier. \nServer Ghostwind is connected with Server Nightfall, Server Darkhorse, Server Frostmoon. \nServer Nightfall is connected with Server Darkhorse, Server Glacier. \nServer Darkhorse is connected with Server Glacier. \n",

  "Q": "Our company has 23 computers connected by several communication links. These computers are named: Server Silverhawk, Server Bluewave, Server Silverstream, Server Ghostwind, Server Vortex, Server Brightstar, Server Frostbite, Server Goldleaf, Server Willowbrook, Server Emberfall, Server Windmill, Server Crimsoncloud, Server Glacierpeak, Server Windswept, Server Sandstorm, Server Solarflare, Server Ravenstone, Server Starfire, Server Thunderbolt, Server Tempest, Server Glacier, Server Ironclad and Server Nightshade. \nTo ensure network security, we need to install monitoring devices (such as firewalls or intrusion detection systems) on some of these computers so that all communication links are monitored. \nAssume that the connections between the computers (i.e., the communication links) are bidirectional. This means that information can flow in both directions across any link. Our goal is to deploy monitoring devices in a way that ensures all communication links are covered by at least one monitoring device. \nProblem: How can we select the minimum number of computers to deploy monitoring devices, such that every communication link is monitored by at least one device? \nCommunication links as follows: : \nServer Silverhawk is connected with Server Ghostwind, Server Vortex, Server Brightstar, Server Goldleaf, Server Glacierpeak, Server Sandstorm, Server Thunderbolt, Server Glacier. \nServer Bluewave is connected with Server Vortex, Server Goldleaf, Server Emberfall, Server Crimsoncloud, Server Glacierpeak, Server Windswept, Server Solarflare, Server Starfire, Server Thunderbolt, Server Tempest, Server Glacier. \nServer Silverstream is connected with Server Goldleaf, Server Willowbrook, Server Thunderbolt, Server Tempest. \nServer Ghostwind is connected with Server Brightstar, Server Goldleaf, Server Sandstorm, Server Solarflare, Server Ravenstone, Server Tempest, Server Glacier, Server Ironclad. \nServer Vortex is connected with Server Brightstar, Server Crimsoncloud, Server Glacierpeak, Server Sandstorm, Server Ravenstone, Server Thunderbolt, Server Glacier. \nServer Brightstar is connected with Server Frostbite, Server Goldleaf, Server Crimsoncloud, Server Sandstorm, Server Ravenstone, Server Starfire, Server Thunderbolt, Server Tempest, Server Nightshade. \nServer Frostbite is connected with Server Goldleaf, Server Windmill, Server Windswept, Server Ravenstone, Server Glacier, Server Nightshade. \nServer Goldleaf is connected with Server Willowbrook, Server Emberfall, Server Windmill, Server Glacierpeak, Server Ravenstone, Server Tempest, Server Ironclad. \nServer Willowbrook is connected with Server Crimsoncloud, Server Solarflare, Server Starfire. \nServer Emberfall is connected with Server Windswept, Server Sandstorm, Server Starfire, Server Thunderbolt, Server Tempest, Server Glacier, Server Ironclad, Server Nightshade. \nServer Windmill is connected with Server Windswept, Server Sandstorm, Server Solarflare, Server Ravenstone, Server Tempest, Server Ironclad, Server Nightshade. \nServer Crimsoncloud is connected with Server Glacierpeak, Server Windswept, Server Solarflare, Server Ravenstone, Server Thunderbolt, Server Nightshade. \nServer Glacierpeak is connected with Server Solarflare, Server Starfire. \nServer Windswept is connected with Server Ravenstone, Server Nightshade. \nServer Sandstorm is connected with Server Solarflare, Server Tempest, Server Nightshade. \nServer Solarflare is connected with Server Ravenstone, Server Starfire, Server Glacier, Server Ironclad, Server Nightshade. \nServer Ravenstone is connected with Server Thunderbolt, Server Ironclad, Server Nightshade. \nServer Thunderbolt is connected with Server Tempest, Server Glacier, Server Nightshade. \nServer Tempest is connected with Server Ironclad. \nServer Glacier is connected with Server Ironclad, Server Nightshade. \n",

  "Q": "Our company has 23 computers connected by several communication links. These computers are named: Server Eaglecrest, Server Seabreeze, Server Sandstorm, Server Moonlight, Server Stormbreaker, Server Falconeye, Server Firefly, Server Vortex, Server Amberwave, Server Ravenstone, Server Silverstone, Server Mirage, Server Ghostwind, Server Emberfall, Server Crimsoncloud, Server Glacier, Server Twilight, Server Windmill, Server Frostbite, Server Nightfall, Server Shadowbrook, Server Solarflare and Server Darkhorse. \nTo ensure network security, we need to install monitoring devices (such as firewalls or intrusion detection systems) on some of these computers so that all communication links are monitored. \nAssume that the connections between the computers (i.e., the communication links) are bidirectional. This means that information can flow in both directions across any link. Our goal is to deploy monitoring devices in a way that ensures all communication links are covered by at least one monitoring device. \nProblem: How can we select the minimum number of computers to deploy monitoring devices, such that every communication link is monitored by at least one device? \nCommunication links as follows: : \nServer Eaglecrest is connected with Server Sandstorm, Server Moonlight, Server Stormbreaker, Server Falconeye, Server Ravenstone, Server Ghostwind, Server Crimsoncloud, Server Glacier, Server Nightfall, Server Shadowbrook, Server Solarflare. \nServer Seabreeze is connected with Server Firefly, Server Ravenstone, Server Ghostwind, Server Crimsoncloud, Server Twilight, Server Frostbite, Server Shadowbrook, Server Darkhorse. \nServer Sandstorm is connected with Server Stormbreaker, Server Ravenstone, Server Silverstone, Server Mirage, Server Ghostwind, Server Twilight, Server Frostbite, Server Nightfall. \nServer Moonlight is connected with Server Ravenstone, Server Silverstone, Server Ghostwind, Server Emberfall, Server Glacier, Server Frostbite, Server Solarflare. \nServer Stormbreaker is connected with Server Vortex, Server Amberwave, Server Mirage, Server Emberfall, Server Glacier, Server Nightfall, Server Shadowbrook, Server Darkhorse. \nServer Falconeye is connected with Server Vortex, Server Mirage, Server Ghostwind, Server Glacier, Server Windmill, Server Nightfall, Server Shadowbrook, Server Solarflare, Server Darkhorse. \nServer Firefly is connected with Server Amberwave, Server Mirage, Server Emberfall, Server Crimsoncloud, Server Glacier, Server Twilight, Server Windmill, Server Frostbite. \nServer Vortex is connected with Server Silverstone, Server Glacier, Server Twilight, Server Frostbite, Server Shadowbrook. \nServer Amberwave is connected with Server Silverstone, Server Emberfall, Server Crimsoncloud, Server Windmill, Server Frostbite, Server Nightfall, Server Shadowbrook, Server Solarflare. \nServer Ravenstone is connected with Server Ghostwind, Server Emberfall, Server Twilight, Server Windmill, Server Solarflare, Server Darkhorse. \nServer Silverstone is connected with Server Mirage, Server Ghostwind, Server Twilight, Server Nightfall, Server Shadowbrook, Server Darkhorse. \nServer Mirage is connected with Server Emberfall, Server Nightfall, Server Darkhorse. \nServer Ghostwind is connected with Server Crimsoncloud, Server Windmill, Server Solarflare. \nServer Emberfall is connected with Server Crimsoncloud, Server Windmill, Server Nightfall. \nServer Crimsoncloud is connected with Server Glacier, Server Twilight, Server Windmill, Server Shadowbrook. \nServer Glacier is connected with Server Frostbite, Server Shadowbrook. \nServer Twilight is connected with Server Frostbite. \nServer Windmill is connected with Server Nightfall, Server Shadowbrook, Server Darkhorse. \nServer Frostbite is connected with Server Darkhorse. \nServer Shadowbrook is connected with Server Solarflare. \n",

  "Q": "Our company has 23 computers connected by several communication links. These computers are named: Server Ironclad, Server Mirage, Server Emberfall, Server Firefly, Server Silverhawk, Server Stormbreaker, Server Glacierpeak, Server Glacier, Server Stealthwind, Server Falconeye, Server Starfire, Server Ironbark, Server Amberwave, Server Moonlight, Server Bluewave, Server Nightfall, Server Firestorm, Server Skyhawk, Server Stormcloud, Server Windmill, Server Windswept, Server Crimsoncloud and Server Solarflare. \nTo ensure network security, we need to install monitoring devices (such as firewalls or intrusion detection systems) on some of these computers so that all communication links are monitored. \nAssume that the connections between the computers (i.e., the communication links) are bidirectional. This means that information can flow in both directions across any link. Our goal is to deploy monitoring devices in a way that ensures all communication links are covered by at least one monitoring device. \nProblem: How can we select the minimum number of computers to deploy monitoring devices, such that every communication link is monitored by at least one device? \nCommunication links as follows: : \nServer Ironclad is connected with Server Silverhawk, Server Stealthwind, Server Starfire, Server Amberwave, Server Moonlight, Server Bluewave, Server Skyhawk. \nServer Mirage is connected with Server Firefly, Server Silverhawk, Server Glacier, Server Stealthwind, Server Falconeye, Server Starfire, Server Ironbark, Server Bluewave, Server Nightfall, Server Windmill. \nServer Emberfall is connected with Server Firefly, Server Silverhawk, Server Falconeye, Server Starfire, Server Amberwave, Server Moonlight, Server Bluewave, Server Stormcloud, Server Crimsoncloud. \nServer Firefly is connected with Server Stealthwind, Server Ironbark, Server Amberwave, Server Nightfall, Server Firestorm, Server Windmill, Server Crimsoncloud. \nServer Silverhawk is connected with Server Stealthwind, Server Ironbark, Server Moonlight, Server Nightfall, Server Solarflare. \nServer Stormbreaker is connected with Server Glacier, Server Stealthwind, Server Falconeye, Server Amberwave, Server Skyhawk, Server Stormcloud, Server Windswept, Server Crimsoncloud, Server Solarflare. \nServer Glacierpeak is connected with Server Glacier, Server Starfire, Server Ironbark, Server Bluewave, Server Nightfall, Server Firestorm, Server Stormcloud, Server Windswept, Server Solarflare. \nServer Glacier is connected with Server Stealthwind, Server Falconeye, Server Starfire, Server Ironbark, Server Nightfall, Server Skyhawk, Server Windswept. \nServer Stealthwind is connected with Server Falconeye, Server Ironbark, Server Nightfall, Server Firestorm, Server Stormcloud, Server Windswept. \nServer Falconeye is connected with Server Starfire, Server Bluewave, Server Firestorm, Server Skyhawk, Server Stormcloud, Server Windmill. \nServer Starfire is connected with Server Bluewave, Server Skyhawk, Server Stormcloud, Server Solarflare. \nServer Ironbark is connected with Server Bluewave, Server Firestorm, Server Crimsoncloud. \nServer Amberwave is connected with Server Moonlight, Server Bluewave, Server Nightfall, Server Stormcloud, Server Crimsoncloud, Server Solarflare. \nServer Moonlight is connected with Server Nightfall, Server Firestorm, Server Crimsoncloud, Server Solarflare. \nServer Bluewave is connected with Server Nightfall, Server Windmill, Server Windswept. \nServer Nightfall is connected with Server Stormcloud, Server Crimsoncloud. \nServer Firestorm is connected with Server Stormcloud. \nServer Skyhawk is connected with Server Stormcloud, Server Windmill. \nServer Stormcloud is connected with Server Windswept, Server Crimsoncloud. \nServer Windmill is connected with Server Crimsoncloud, Server Solarflare. \nServer Crimsoncloud is connected with Server Solarflare. \n",

  "Q": "Our company has 23 computers connected by several communication links. These computers are named: Server Brightstar, Server Seabreeze, Server Goldleaf, Server Mirage, Server Darkhorse, Server Stormbreaker, Server Frostbite, Server Windswept, Server Thunderstrike, Server Lighthouse, Server Tempest, Server Glacierpeak, Server Glacier, Server Redwood, Server Nightfall, Server Bluewave, Server Skyhawk, Server Sandstorm, Server Silverhawk, Server Ironbark, Server Emberfall, Server Ironclad and Server Firefly. \nTo ensure network security, we need to install monitoring devices (such as firewalls or intrusion detection systems) on some of these computers so that all communication links are monitored. \nAssume that the connections between the computers (i.e., the communication links) are bidirectional. This means that information can flow in both directions across any link. Our goal is to deploy monitoring devices in a way that ensures all communication links are covered by at least one monitoring device. \nProblem: How can we select the minimum number of computers to deploy monitoring devices, such that every communication link is monitored by at least one device? \nCommunication links as follows: : \nServer Brightstar is connected with Server Goldleaf, Server Windswept, Server Thunderstrike, Server Glacierpeak, Server Glacier, Server Nightfall, Server Bluewave, Server Sandstorm, Server Firefly. \nServer Seabreeze is connected with Server Darkhorse, Server Stormbreaker, Server Frostbite, Server Tempest, Server Glacierpeak, Server Glacier, Server Redwood, Server Nightfall, Server Bluewave, Server Sandstorm, Server Silverhawk, Server Ironbark, Server Emberfall, Server Ironclad, Server Firefly. \nServer Goldleaf is connected with Server Darkhorse, Server Frostbite, Server Redwood, Server Nightfall, Server Skyhawk, Server Sandstorm, Server Firefly. \nServer Mirage is connected with Server Stormbreaker, Server Windswept, Server Thunderstrike, Server Glacierpeak, Server Redwood, Server Sandstorm, Server Emberfall. \nServer Darkhorse is connected with Server Stormbreaker, Server Frostbite, Server Windswept, Server Glacier, Server Silverhawk, Server Ironclad. \nServer Stormbreaker is connected with Server Thunderstrike, Server Lighthouse, Server Tempest, Server Glacierpeak, Server Glacier, Server Redwood, Server Nightfall, Server Bluewave, Server Sandstorm, Server Emberfall, Server Ironclad. \nServer Frostbite is connected with Server Windswept, Server Lighthouse, Server Glacierpeak, Server Skyhawk, Server Ironclad, Server Firefly. \nServer Windswept is connected with Server Lighthouse, Server Redwood, Server Ironbark, Server Emberfall. \nServer Thunderstrike is connected with Server Redwood, Server Nightfall, Server Bluewave, Server Emberfall, Server Ironclad, Server Firefly. \nServer Lighthouse is connected with Server Tempest, Server Bluewave, Server Skyhawk, Server Silverhawk, Server Ironclad. \nServer Tempest is connected with Server Glacierpeak, Server Nightfall, Server Sandstorm, Server Silverhawk, Server Emberfall. \nServer Glacierpeak is connected with Server Ironbark. \nServer Glacier is connected with Server Nightfall, Server Skyhawk, Server Sandstorm, Server Ironbark, Server Emberfall, Server Firefly. \nServer Redwood is connected with Server Nightfall, Server Skyhawk, Server Sandstorm, Server Silverhawk, Server Firefly. \nServer Nightfall is connected with Server Ironclad. \nServer Bluewave is connected with Server Skyhawk, Server Sandstorm, Server Silverhawk, Server Emberfall, Server Ironclad. \nServer Skyhawk is connected with Server Sandstorm, Server Firefly. \nServer Sandstorm is connected with Server Firefly. \nServer Silverhawk is connected with Server Ironbark, Server Firefly. \nServer Ironbark is connected with Server Firefly. \n",

  "Q": "Our company has 23 computers connected by several communication links. These computers are named: Server Emberlight, Server Windmill, Server Sandstorm, Server Firefly, Server Shadowbrook, Server Lighthouse, Server Frostbite, Server Oceanview, Server Tempest, Server Windswept, Server Twilight, Server Glacier, Server Ironclad, Server Brightstar, Server Nightfall, Server Falconeye, Server Nightshade, Server Bluewave, Server Ghostwind, Server Emberfall, Server Moonlight, Server Ravenstone and Server Willowbrook. \nTo ensure network security, we need to install monitoring devices (such as firewalls or intrusion detection systems) on some of these computers so that all communication links are monitored. \nAssume that the connections between the computers (i.e., the communication links) are bidirectional. This means that information can flow in both directions across any link. Our goal is to deploy monitoring devices in a way that ensures all communication links are covered by at least one monitoring device. \nProblem: How can we select the minimum number of computers to deploy monitoring devices, such that every communication link is monitored by at least one device? \nCommunication links as follows: : \nServer Emberlight is connected with Server Frostbite, Server Windswept, Server Glacier, Server Ironclad, Server Nightfall, Server Falconeye, Server Nightshade, Server Ravenstone. \nServer Windmill is connected with Server Sandstorm, Server Shadowbrook, Server Lighthouse, Server Frostbite, Server Oceanview, Server Twilight, Server Ironclad, Server Nightfall, Server Bluewave, Server Emberfall. \nServer Sandstorm is connected with Server Windswept, Server Twilight, Server Glacier, Server Ironclad, Server Ravenstone, Server Willowbrook. \nServer Firefly is connected with Server Frostbite, Server Tempest, Server Windswept, Server Glacier, Server Nightfall, Server Moonlight, Server Ravenstone. \nServer Shadowbrook is connected with Server Lighthouse, Server Oceanview, Server Brightstar, Server Nightfall, Server Falconeye, Server Nightshade, Server Bluewave, Server Ghostwind, Server Moonlight, Server Ravenstone. \nServer Lighthouse is connected with Server Oceanview, Server Windswept, Server Twilight, Server Nightfall, Server Falconeye, Server Bluewave, Server Ravenstone. \nServer Frostbite is connected with Server Oceanview, Server Twilight, Server Glacier, Server Ironclad, Server Brightstar, Server Ghostwind, Server Emberfall, Server Moonlight. \nServer Oceanview is connected with Server Tempest, Server Windswept, Server Twilight, Server Ironclad, Server Falconeye, Server Willowbrook. \nServer Tempest is connected with Server Ironclad, Server Bluewave, Server Emberfall, Server Ravenstone. \nServer Windswept is connected with Server Twilight, Server Ironclad, Server Nightfall, Server Nightshade, Server Bluewave, Server Moonlight. \nServer Twilight is connected with Server Glacier, Server Nightfall, Server Falconeye, Server Nightshade, Server Ghostwind, Server Moonlight. \nServer Glacier is connected with Server Ironclad, Server Brightstar, Server Nightfall, Server Falconeye, Server Nightshade, Server Emberfall, Server Willowbrook. \nServer Ironclad is connected with Server Brightstar, Server Nightfall, Server Falconeye, Server Ghostwind. \nServer Brightstar is connected with Server Nightfall, Server Nightshade, Server Ravenstone, Server Willowbrook. \nServer Nightfall is connected with Server Ghostwind, Server Moonlight, Server Ravenstone. \nServer Nightshade is connected with Server Ghostwind, Server Moonlight, Server Willowbrook. \nServer Bluewave is connected with Server Emberfall, Server Ravenstone. \nServer Ghostwind is connected with Server Moonlight, Server Ravenstone. \nServer Moonlight is connected with Server Ravenstone, Server Willowbrook. \n",

  "Q": "Our company has 23 computers connected by several communication links. These computers are named: Server Windswept, Server Emberlight, Server Darkhorse, Server Frostmoon, Server Stormcloud, Server Oceanview, Server Bluewave, Server Firestorm, Server Ghostwind, Server Thunderbolt, Server Willowbrook, Server Crimsoncloud, Server Ironclad, Server Redwood, Server Lighthouse, Server Stealthwind, Server Amberwave, Server Solarflare, Server Shadowbrook, Server Emberfall, Server Starfire, Server Firefly and Server Brightstar. \nTo ensure network security, we need to install monitoring devices (such as firewalls or intrusion detection systems) on some of these computers so that all communication links are monitored. \nAssume that the connections between the computers (i.e., the communication links) are bidirectional. This means that information can flow in both directions across any link. Our goal is to deploy monitoring devices in a way that ensures all communication links are covered by at least one monitoring device. \nProblem: How can we select the minimum number of computers to deploy monitoring devices, such that every communication link is monitored by at least one device? \nCommunication links as follows: : \nServer Windswept is connected with Server Emberlight, Server Darkhorse, Server Oceanview, Server Bluewave, Server Firestorm, Server Willowbrook, Server Redwood, Server Lighthouse, Server Starfire, Server Firefly. \nServer Emberlight is connected with Server Bluewave, Server Thunderbolt, Server Willowbrook, Server Ironclad, Server Redwood, Server Lighthouse, Server Solarflare, Server Emberfall, Server Starfire, Server Firefly. \nServer Darkhorse is connected with Server Oceanview, Server Ghostwind, Server Thunderbolt, Server Redwood, Server Lighthouse, Server Emberfall, Server Starfire, Server Brightstar. \nServer Frostmoon is connected with Server Oceanview, Server Thunderbolt, Server Redwood, Server Emberfall, Server Firefly, Server Brightstar. \nServer Stormcloud is connected with Server Oceanview, Server Firestorm, Server Thunderbolt, Server Willowbrook, Server Redwood, Server Lighthouse, Server Amberwave, Server Solarflare, Server Brightstar. \nServer Oceanview is connected with Server Redwood, Server Stealthwind, Server Amberwave, Server Solarflare, Server Emberfall, Server Brightstar. \nServer Bluewave is connected with Server Firestorm, Server Thunderbolt, Server Willowbrook, Server Crimsoncloud, Server Lighthouse, Server Stealthwind, Server Solarflare, Server Firefly. \nServer Firestorm is connected with Server Ghostwind, Server Thunderbolt, Server Crimsoncloud, Server Redwood, Server Amberwave, Server Shadowbrook, Server Starfire, Server Firefly. \nServer Ghostwind is connected with Server Willowbrook, Server Crimsoncloud, Server Redwood, Server Lighthouse, Server Amberwave, Server Starfire, Server Firefly. \nServer Thunderbolt is connected with Server Willowbrook, Server Redwood, Server Lighthouse, Server Stealthwind, Server Emberfall, Server Brightstar. \nServer Willowbrook is connected with Server Lighthouse, Server Amberwave, Server Shadowbrook. \nServer Crimsoncloud is connected with Server Amberwave, Server Starfire, Server Firefly. \nServer Ironclad is connected with Server Redwood, Server Lighthouse, Server Solarflare. \nServer Redwood is connected with Server Stealthwind, Server Amberwave, Server Solarflare, Server Shadowbrook. \nServer Lighthouse is connected with Server Amberwave, Server Emberfall, Server Starfire, Server Firefly. \nServer Stealthwind is connected with Server Emberfall. \nServer Amberwave is connected with Server Shadowbrook, Server Emberfall, Server Brightstar. \nServer Solarflare is connected with Server Shadowbrook, Server Emberfall, Server Firefly. \nServer Shadowbrook is connected with Server Starfire. \nServer Emberfall is connected with Server Starfire. \nServer Starfire is connected with Server Brightstar. \n",

  "Q": "Our company has 23 computers connected by several communication links. These computers are named: Server Stormcloud, Server Ravenstone, Server Windmill, Server Frostbite, Server Frostmoon, Server Windswept, Server Moonlight, Server Sunflower, Server Nightshade, Server Nightfall, Server Darkhorse, Server Oceanview, Server Emberfall, Server Glacier, Server Lighthouse, Server Starfire, Server Firestorm, Server Stormbreaker, Server Ironbark, Server Skyhawk, Server Firefly, Server Bluewave and Server Mirage. \nTo ensure network security, we need to install monitoring devices (such as firewalls or intrusion detection systems) on some of these computers so that all communication links are monitored. \nAssume that the connections between the computers (i.e., the communication links) are bidirectional. This means that information can flow in both directions across any link. Our goal is to deploy monitoring devices in a way that ensures all communication links are covered by at least one monitoring device. \nProblem: How can we select the minimum number of computers to deploy monitoring devices, such that every communication link is monitored by at least one device? \nCommunication links as follows: : \nServer Stormcloud is connected with Server Windmill, Server Frostbite, Server Moonlight, Server Nightshade, Server Glacier, Server Starfire, Server Ironbark, Server Firefly. \nServer Ravenstone is connected with Server Nightshade, Server Darkhorse, Server Emberfall, Server Glacier, Server Starfire, Server Firestorm, Server Stormbreaker, Server Ironbark, Server Mirage. \nServer Windmill is connected with Server Frostbite, Server Windswept, Server Sunflower, Server Nightfall, Server Oceanview, Server Starfire, Server Ironbark, Server Skyhawk. \nServer Frostbite is connected with Server Frostmoon, Server Nightfall, Server Darkhorse, Server Oceanview, Server Firestorm, Server Firefly, Server Bluewave. \nServer Frostmoon is connected with Server Sunflower, Server Darkhorse, Server Glacier, Server Stormbreaker, Server Skyhawk, Server Firefly, Server Bluewave. \nServer Windswept is connected with Server Nightfall, Server Firestorm, Server Skyhawk, Server Bluewave. \nServer Moonlight is connected with Server Sunflower, Server Nightfall, Server Oceanview, Server Emberfall, Server Glacier, Server Starfire, Server Skyhawk, Server Firefly, Server Mirage. \nServer Sunflower is connected with Server Nightfall, Server Darkhorse, Server Oceanview, Server Glacier, Server Lighthouse, Server Firestorm. \nServer Nightshade is connected with Server Nightfall, Server Oceanview, Server Starfire, Server Firestorm, Server Stormbreaker, Server Skyhawk, Server Firefly, Server Mirage. \nServer Nightfall is connected with Server Darkhorse, Server Emberfall, Server Lighthouse, Server Firestorm, Server Stormbreaker, Server Ironbark, Server Skyhawk, Server Firefly. \nServer Darkhorse is connected with Server Oceanview, Server Emberfall, Server Firestorm, Server Stormbreaker, Server Firefly, Server Mirage. \nServer Oceanview is connected with Server Firestorm, Server Ironbark, Server Skyhawk. \nServer Emberfall is connected with Server Lighthouse, Server Starfire, Server Firestorm, Server Bluewave. \nServer Glacier is connected with Server Lighthouse, Server Starfire, Server Skyhawk, Server Bluewave. \nServer Lighthouse is connected with Server Stormbreaker, Server Skyhawk. \nServer Starfire is connected with Server Firestorm, Server Ironbark, Server Bluewave, Server Mirage. \nServer Firestorm is connected with Server Ironbark, Server Mirage. \nServer Stormbreaker is connected with Server Ironbark, Server Firefly, Server Mirage. \nServer Ironbark is connected with Server Bluewave. \nServer Skyhawk is connected with Server Mirage. \nServer Firefly is connected with Server Bluewave. \n",

  "Q": "Our company has 23 computers connected by several communication links. These computers are named: Server Bluebird, Server Sandstorm, Server Redwood, Server Eaglecrest, Server Firefly, Server Stealthwind, Server Stormbreaker, Server Moonlight, Server Ravenstone, Server Ghostwind, Server Windswept, Server Nightshade, Server Skyhawk, Server Ironbark, Server Stormcloud, Server Sunflower, Server Amberwave, Server Windmill, Server Emberlight, Server Twilight, Server Vortex, Server Thunderstrike and Server Oceanview. \nTo ensure network security, we need to install monitoring devices (such as firewalls or intrusion detection systems) on some of these computers so that all communication links are monitored. \nAssume that the connections between the computers (i.e., the communication links) are bidirectional. This means that information can flow in both directions across any link. Our goal is to deploy monitoring devices in a way that ensures all communication links are covered by at least one monitoring device. \nProblem: How can we select the minimum number of computers to deploy monitoring devices, such that every communication link is monitored by at least one device? \nCommunication links as follows: : \nServer Bluebird is connected with Server Eaglecrest, Server Firefly, Server Ghostwind, Server Windswept, Server Skyhawk, Server Windmill, Server Oceanview. \nServer Sandstorm is connected with Server Redwood, Server Stormbreaker, Server Moonlight, Server Ravenstone, Server Ghostwind, Server Windswept, Server Nightshade, Server Ironbark, Server Amberwave, Server Emberlight, Server Thunderstrike, Server Oceanview. \nServer Redwood is connected with Server Eaglecrest, Server Stealthwind, Server Stormbreaker, Server Ravenstone, Server Ghostwind, Server Windswept, Server Stormcloud, Server Thunderstrike. \nServer Eaglecrest is connected with Server Firefly, Server Moonlight, Server Ravenstone, Server Ghostwind, Server Skyhawk, Server Ironbark, Server Stormcloud, Server Sunflower, Server Amberwave, Server Vortex, Server Oceanview. \nServer Firefly is connected with Server Stealthwind, Server Moonlight, Server Stormcloud, Server Windmill, Server Emberlight, Server Vortex, Server Thunderstrike, Server Oceanview. \nServer Stealthwind is connected with Server Stormbreaker, Server Skyhawk, Server Ironbark, Server Windmill, Server Emberlight, Server Vortex. \nServer Stormbreaker is connected with Server Moonlight, Server Nightshade, Server Sunflower, Server Amberwave, Server Windmill, Server Twilight. \nServer Moonlight is connected with Server Ravenstone, Server Nightshade, Server Amberwave, Server Windmill, Server Thunderstrike. \nServer Ravenstone is connected with Server Ghostwind, Server Windswept, Server Nightshade, Server Ironbark, Server Stormcloud, Server Windmill, Server Oceanview. \nServer Ghostwind is connected with Server Sunflower, Server Amberwave, Server Emberlight, Server Vortex, Server Oceanview. \nServer Windswept is connected with Server Skyhawk, Server Sunflower, Server Windmill, Server Twilight, Server Thunderstrike. \nServer Nightshade is connected with Server Ironbark, Server Sunflower, Server Amberwave, Server Windmill, Server Emberlight, Server Twilight, Server Oceanview. \nServer Skyhawk is connected with Server Ironbark, Server Sunflower, Server Twilight, Server Vortex, Server Thunderstrike. \nServer Ironbark is connected with Server Stormcloud, Server Emberlight, Server Vortex, Server Oceanview. \nServer Stormcloud is connected with Server Amberwave, Server Oceanview. \nServer Sunflower is connected with Server Twilight. \nServer Windmill is connected with Server Twilight, Server Vortex. \nServer Emberlight is connected with Server Twilight, Server Vortex. \nServer Twilight is connected with Server Vortex, Server Oceanview. \n",

  "Q": "Our company has 23 computers connected by several communication links. These computers are named: Server Frostbite, Server Stormcloud, Server Blackwood, Server Redwood, Server Stormbreaker, Server Ironbark, Server Glacier, Server Ghostwind, Server Lighthouse, Server Nightshade, Server Windmill, Server Starfire, Server Amberwave, Server Bluewave, Server Ironclad, Server Oceanview, Server Falconeye, Server Silverstream, Server Crimsoncloud, Server Emberlight, Server Willowbrook, Server Sandstorm and Server Tempest. \nTo ensure network security, we need to install monitoring devices (such as firewalls or intrusion detection systems) on some of these computers so that all communication links are monitored. \nAssume that the connections between the computers (i.e., the communication links) are bidirectional. This means that information can flow in both directions across any link. Our goal is to deploy monitoring devices in a way that ensures all communication links are covered by at least one monitoring device. \nProblem: How can we select the minimum number of computers to deploy monitoring devices, such that every communication link is monitored by at least one device? \nCommunication links as follows: : \nServer Frostbite is connected with Server Blackwood, Server Ironbark, Server Glacier, Server Lighthouse, Server Windmill, Server Starfire, Server Amberwave, Server Silverstream, Server Willowbrook, Server Sandstorm. \nServer Stormcloud is connected with Server Blackwood, Server Nightshade, Server Ironclad, Server Oceanview, Server Crimsoncloud, Server Emberlight. \nServer Blackwood is connected with Server Stormbreaker, Server Oceanview, Server Silverstream. \nServer Redwood is connected with Server Glacier, Server Nightshade, Server Windmill, Server Starfire, Server Amberwave, Server Ironclad, Server Falconeye, Server Silverstream, Server Crimsoncloud, Server Emberlight. \nServer Stormbreaker is connected with Server Lighthouse, Server Nightshade, Server Starfire, Server Oceanview, Server Emberlight, Server Willowbrook, Server Sandstorm. \nServer Ironbark is connected with Server Nightshade, Server Windmill, Server Starfire, Server Amberwave, Server Ironclad, Server Oceanview, Server Falconeye, Server Silverstream, Server Emberlight, Server Willowbrook, Server Tempest. \nServer Glacier is connected with Server Starfire, Server Ironclad, Server Silverstream, Server Crimsoncloud, Server Sandstorm. \nServer Ghostwind is connected with Server Nightshade, Server Starfire, Server Bluewave, Server Ironclad, Server Oceanview, Server Falconeye, Server Emberlight, Server Sandstorm. \nServer Lighthouse is connected with Server Windmill, Server Amberwave, Server Falconeye, Server Crimsoncloud, Server Tempest. \nServer Nightshade is connected with Server Windmill, Server Starfire, Server Amberwave, Server Oceanview, Server Falconeye, Server Crimsoncloud, Server Emberlight, Server Willowbrook, Server Sandstorm. \nServer Windmill is connected with Server Ironclad, Server Falconeye, Server Emberlight, Server Sandstorm. \nServer Starfire is connected with Server Crimsoncloud, Server Emberlight, Server Tempest. \nServer Amberwave is connected with Server Ironclad, Server Oceanview, Server Crimsoncloud, Server Tempest. \nServer Bluewave is connected with Server Oceanview, Server Falconeye, Server Emberlight, Server Tempest. \nServer Ironclad is connected with Server Oceanview, Server Falconeye. \nServer Oceanview is connected with Server Silverstream, Server Crimsoncloud, Server Willowbrook. \nServer Falconeye is connected with Server Willowbrook, Server Sandstorm, Server Tempest. \nServer Silverstream is connected with Server Sandstorm, Server Tempest. \nServer Crimsoncloud is connected with Server Willowbrook, Server Sandstorm, Server Tempest. \nServer Emberlight is connected with Server Sandstorm. \nServer Willowbrook is connected with Server Sandstorm, Server Tempest. \n",

  "Q": "Our company has 23 computers connected by several communication links. These computers are named: Server Glacierpeak, Server Firefly, Server Nightfall, Server Bluebird, Server Solarflare, Server Goldleaf, Server Willowbrook, Server Sunflower, Server Thunderbolt, Server Crimsoncloud, Server Shadowbrook, Server Mirage, Server Brightstar, Server Tempest, Server Ravenstone, Server Sandstorm, Server Amberwave, Server Silverstream, Server Stormbreaker, Server Lighthouse, Server Glacier, Server Skyhawk and Server Silverstone. \nTo ensure network security, we need to install monitoring devices (such as firewalls or intrusion detection systems) on some of these computers so that all communication links are monitored. \nAssume that the connections between the computers (i.e., the communication links) are bidirectional. This means that information can flow in both directions across any link. Our goal is to deploy monitoring devices in a way that ensures all communication links are covered by at least one monitoring device. \nProblem: How can we select the minimum number of computers to deploy monitoring devices, such that every communication link is monitored by at least one device? \nCommunication links as follows: : \nServer Glacierpeak is connected with Server Firefly, Server Nightfall, Server Bluebird, Server Goldleaf, Server Willowbrook, Server Thunderbolt, Server Shadowbrook, Server Brightstar, Server Ravenstone, Server Sandstorm, Server Silverstone. \nServer Firefly is connected with Server Crimsoncloud, Server Shadowbrook, Server Ravenstone, Server Sandstorm, Server Amberwave, Server Silverstone. \nServer Nightfall is connected with Server Bluebird, Server Sunflower, Server Crimsoncloud, Server Ravenstone, Server Sandstorm, Server Silverstream, Server Stormbreaker, Server Lighthouse, Server Glacier, Server Skyhawk. \nServer Bluebird is connected with Server Sunflower, Server Crimsoncloud, Server Tempest, Server Ravenstone, Server Sandstorm, Server Amberwave, Server Glacier, Server Silverstone. \nServer Solarflare is connected with Server Goldleaf, Server Willowbrook, Server Ravenstone, Server Sandstorm, Server Amberwave, Server Glacier. \nServer Goldleaf is connected with Server Sunflower, Server Thunderbolt, Server Mirage, Server Tempest, Server Silverstream, Server Stormbreaker, Server Silverstone. \nServer Willowbrook is connected with Server Crimsoncloud, Server Mirage, Server Sandstorm, Server Amberwave, Server Lighthouse, Server Silverstone. \nServer Sunflower is connected with Server Thunderbolt, Server Crimsoncloud, Server Tempest, Server Ravenstone, Server Amberwave, Server Silverstream, Server Silverstone. \nServer Thunderbolt is connected with Server Crimsoncloud, Server Brightstar, Server Tempest, Server Sandstorm, Server Silverstream, Server Stormbreaker, Server Glacier. \nServer Crimsoncloud is connected with Server Shadowbrook, Server Lighthouse, Server Skyhawk. \nServer Shadowbrook is connected with Server Mirage, Server Sandstorm, Server Lighthouse, Server Silverstone. \nServer Mirage is connected with Server Ravenstone, Server Amberwave, Server Lighthouse, Server Glacier, Server Skyhawk, Server Silverstone. \nServer Brightstar is connected with Server Ravenstone, Server Sandstorm, Server Silverstone. \nServer Tempest is connected with Server Sandstorm, Server Amberwave, Server Silverstream, Server Glacier. \nServer Ravenstone is connected with Server Amberwave, Server Stormbreaker, Server Lighthouse. \nServer Sandstorm is connected with Server Amberwave, Server Silverstream, Server Skyhawk, Server Silverstone. \nServer Amberwave is connected with Server Silverstream, Server Glacier, Server Skyhawk. \nServer Silverstream is connected with Server Stormbreaker, Server Glacier, Server Skyhawk, Server Silverstone. \nServer Stormbreaker is connected with Server Glacier. \nServer Lighthouse is connected with Server Glacier, Server Silverstone. \n",

  "Q": "Our company has 23 computers connected by several communication links. These computers are named: Server Nightfall, Server Ravenstone, Server Eaglecrest, Server Emberfall, Server Windmill, Server Silverstream, Server Sandstorm, Server Bluewave, Server Frostmoon, Server Thunderbolt, Server Bluebird, Server Sunflower, Server Firestorm, Server Tempest, Server Windswept, Server Darkhorse, Server Willowbrook, Server Ironbark, Server Starfire, Server Ghostwind, Server Silverstone, Server Goldleaf and Server Frostbite. \nTo ensure network security, we need to install monitoring devices (such as firewalls or intrusion detection systems) on some of these computers so that all communication links are monitored. \nAssume that the connections between the computers (i.e., the communication links) are bidirectional. This means that information can flow in both directions across any link. Our goal is to deploy monitoring devices in a way that ensures all communication links are covered by at least one monitoring device. \nProblem: How can we select the minimum number of computers to deploy monitoring devices, such that every communication link is monitored by at least one device? \nCommunication links as follows: : \nServer Nightfall is connected with Server Eaglecrest, Server Windmill, Server Bluebird, Server Sunflower, Server Tempest, Server Windswept, Server Darkhorse, Server Willowbrook. \nServer Ravenstone is connected with Server Eaglecrest, Server Bluewave, Server Frostmoon, Server Bluebird, Server Sunflower, Server Darkhorse, Server Ghostwind, Server Goldleaf. \nServer Eaglecrest is connected with Server Emberfall, Server Windmill, Server Sandstorm, Server Frostmoon, Server Bluebird, Server Firestorm, Server Windswept, Server Willowbrook, Server Silverstone, Server Frostbite. \nServer Emberfall is connected with Server Bluewave, Server Bluebird, Server Firestorm, Server Silverstone, Server Goldleaf. \nServer Windmill is connected with Server Sandstorm, Server Frostmoon, Server Thunderbolt, Server Sunflower, Server Tempest, Server Darkhorse, Server Willowbrook, Server Starfire, Server Ghostwind, Server Silverstone, Server Goldleaf. \nServer Silverstream is connected with Server Sandstorm, Server Thunderbolt, Server Tempest, Server Windswept, Server Willowbrook, Server Frostbite. \nServer Sandstorm is connected with Server Frostmoon, Server Thunderbolt, Server Firestorm, Server Tempest, Server Willowbrook, Server Starfire, Server Ghostwind, Server Goldleaf, Server Frostbite. \nServer Bluewave is connected with Server Thunderbolt, Server Tempest, Server Willowbrook, Server Frostbite. \nServer Frostmoon is connected with Server Thunderbolt, Server Bluebird, Server Sunflower, Server Darkhorse, Server Willowbrook. \nServer Thunderbolt is connected with Server Bluebird, Server Firestorm, Server Tempest, Server Windswept, Server Darkhorse, Server Frostbite. \nServer Bluebird is connected with Server Firestorm, Server Windswept, Server Willowbrook, Server Ironbark, Server Starfire. \nServer Sunflower is connected with Server Firestorm, Server Darkhorse, Server Willowbrook, Server Ghostwind, Server Frostbite. \nServer Firestorm is connected with Server Windswept, Server Willowbrook, Server Ghostwind, Server Silverstone, Server Goldleaf, Server Frostbite. \nServer Tempest is connected with Server Ironbark, Server Goldleaf. \nServer Windswept is connected with Server Willowbrook, Server Ironbark, Server Starfire, Server Ghostwind. \nServer Darkhorse is connected with Server Willowbrook, Server Ironbark, Server Ghostwind. \nServer Willowbrook is connected with Server Silverstone, Server Frostbite. \nServer Ironbark is connected with Server Goldleaf. \nServer Starfire is connected with Server Ghostwind, Server Frostbite. \nServer Ghostwind is connected with Server Goldleaf, Server Frostbite. \nServer Silverstone is connected with Server Frostbite. \n",

  "Q": "Our company has 23 computers connected by several communication links. These computers are named: Server Sandstorm, Server Bluebird, Server Goldleaf, Server Emberlight, Server Crimsoncloud, Server Frostmoon, Server Ghostwind, Server Stormbreaker, Server Bluewave, Server Solarflare, Server Redwood, Server Thunderstrike, Server Eaglecrest, Server Glacierpeak, Server Twilight, Server Mirage, Server Stealthwind, Server Firestorm, Server Seabreeze, Server Silverhawk, Server Nightshade, Server Glacier and Server Vortex. \nTo ensure network security, we need to install monitoring devices (such as firewalls or intrusion detection systems) on some of these computers so that all communication links are monitored. \nAssume that the connections between the computers (i.e., the communication links) are bidirectional. This means that information can flow in both directions across any link. Our goal is to deploy monitoring devices in a way that ensures all communication links are covered by at least one monitoring device. \nProblem: How can we select the minimum number of computers to deploy monitoring devices, such that every communication link is monitored by at least one device? \nCommunication links as follows: : \nServer Sandstorm is connected with Server Solarflare, Server Thunderstrike, Server Silverhawk, Server Glacier, Server Vortex. \nServer Bluebird is connected with Server Goldleaf, Server Emberlight, Server Crimsoncloud, Server Ghostwind, Server Stormbreaker, Server Thunderstrike, Server Seabreeze, Server Silverhawk, Server Nightshade. \nServer Goldleaf is connected with Server Eaglecrest, Server Glacierpeak, Server Twilight, Server Stealthwind, Server Firestorm, Server Glacier. \nServer Emberlight is connected with Server Frostmoon, Server Ghostwind, Server Redwood, Server Thunderstrike, Server Twilight, Server Mirage, Server Stealthwind, Server Firestorm, Server Vortex. \nServer Crimsoncloud is connected with Server Ghostwind, Server Solarflare, Server Eaglecrest, Server Glacierpeak, Server Twilight, Server Mirage, Server Firestorm, Server Silverhawk, Server Glacier. \nServer Frostmoon is connected with Server Ghostwind, Server Stormbreaker, Server Bluewave, Server Redwood, Server Thunderstrike, Server Twilight, Server Mirage, Server Silverhawk. \nServer Ghostwind is connected with Server Solarflare, Server Redwood, Server Eaglecrest, Server Twilight, Server Mirage, Server Stealthwind, Server Firestorm, Server Seabreeze, Server Silverhawk, Server Nightshade. \nServer Stormbreaker is connected with Server Solarflare, Server Thunderstrike, Server Glacierpeak, Server Twilight, Server Mirage, Server Stealthwind, Server Nightshade, Server Glacier, Server Vortex. \nServer Bluewave is connected with Server Solarflare, Server Thunderstrike, Server Firestorm, Server Seabreeze, Server Silverhawk. \nServer Solarflare is connected with Server Stealthwind, Server Nightshade, Server Glacier, Server Vortex. \nServer Redwood is connected with Server Thunderstrike, Server Eaglecrest, Server Glacierpeak. \nServer Thunderstrike is connected with Server Twilight, Server Mirage, Server Stealthwind, Server Firestorm, Server Glacier. \nServer Eaglecrest is connected with Server Mirage, Server Stealthwind, Server Firestorm, Server Seabreeze, Server Nightshade, Server Vortex. \nServer Glacierpeak is connected with Server Mirage, Server Stealthwind, Server Firestorm, Server Seabreeze, Server Silverhawk. \nServer Twilight is connected with Server Mirage, Server Stealthwind, Server Nightshade. \nServer Mirage is connected with Server Stealthwind, Server Nightshade, Server Vortex. \nServer Stealthwind is connected with Server Silverhawk, Server Vortex. \nServer Seabreeze is connected with Server Silverhawk, Server Nightshade. \nServer Silverhawk is connected with Server Vortex. \nServer Glacier is connected with Server Vortex. \n",

  "Q": "Our company has 23 computers connected by several communication links. These computers are named: Server Skyhawk, Server Twilight, Server Glacierpeak, Server Sunflower, Server Tempest, Server Frostmoon, Server Blackwood, Server Glacier, Server Ironbark, Server Shadowbrook, Server Mirage, Server Darkhorse, Server Stormcloud, Server Oceanview, Server Redwood, Server Ghostwind, Server Emberlight, Server Ravenstone, Server Amberwave, Server Nightfall, Server Stealthwind, Server Firestorm and Server Windmill. \nTo ensure network security, we need to install monitoring devices (such as firewalls or intrusion detection systems) on some of these computers so that all communication links are monitored. \nAssume that the connections between the computers (i.e., the communication links) are bidirectional. This means that information can flow in both directions across any link. Our goal is to deploy monitoring devices in a way that ensures all communication links are covered by at least one monitoring device. \nProblem: How can we select the minimum number of computers to deploy monitoring devices, such that every communication link is monitored by at least one device? \nCommunication links as follows: : \nServer Skyhawk is connected with Server Twilight, Server Glacierpeak, Server Tempest, Server Glacier, Server Shadowbrook, Server Darkhorse, Server Oceanview, Server Redwood, Server Ravenstone, Server Stealthwind, Server Windmill. \nServer Twilight is connected with Server Shadowbrook, Server Darkhorse, Server Stormcloud, Server Stealthwind. \nServer Glacierpeak is connected with Server Frostmoon, Server Shadowbrook, Server Mirage, Server Oceanview, Server Redwood, Server Nightfall, Server Firestorm, Server Windmill. \nServer Sunflower is connected with Server Tempest, Server Blackwood, Server Shadowbrook, Server Darkhorse, Server Stormcloud, Server Oceanview, Server Redwood, Server Ghostwind, Server Emberlight, Server Ravenstone, Server Windmill. \nServer Tempest is connected with Server Frostmoon, Server Glacier, Server Shadowbrook, Server Stormcloud, Server Ravenstone, Server Nightfall, Server Windmill. \nServer Frostmoon is connected with Server Blackwood, Server Shadowbrook, Server Darkhorse, Server Stormcloud, Server Oceanview, Server Ghostwind, Server Emberlight, Server Firestorm. \nServer Blackwood is connected with Server Ironbark, Server Stormcloud, Server Emberlight, Server Stealthwind. \nServer Glacier is connected with Server Ironbark, Server Stormcloud, Server Redwood, Server Ghostwind, Server Emberlight, Server Ravenstone, Server Stealthwind, Server Firestorm, Server Windmill. \nServer Ironbark is connected with Server Darkhorse, Server Oceanview, Server Redwood, Server Nightfall, Server Stealthwind, Server Firestorm. \nServer Shadowbrook is connected with Server Darkhorse, Server Stormcloud, Server Oceanview, Server Redwood, Server Ghostwind, Server Amberwave, Server Stealthwind. \nServer Mirage is connected with Server Darkhorse, Server Oceanview, Server Emberlight, Server Amberwave, Server Nightfall, Server Stealthwind. \nServer Darkhorse is connected with Server Stormcloud, Server Redwood, Server Nightfall, Server Stealthwind, Server Firestorm, Server Windmill. \nServer Stormcloud is connected with Server Emberlight, Server Amberwave, Server Firestorm. \nServer Oceanview is connected with Server Redwood, Server Emberlight, Server Stealthwind, Server Windmill. \nServer Redwood is connected with Server Ravenstone, Server Stealthwind. \nServer Ghostwind is connected with Server Emberlight, Server Nightfall, Server Firestorm. \nServer Emberlight is connected with Server Nightfall, Server Windmill. \nServer Ravenstone is connected with Server Amberwave, Server Windmill. \nServer Amberwave is connected with Server Windmill. \nServer Stealthwind is connected with Server Windmill. \n",

  "Q": "Our company has 23 computers connected by several communication links. These computers are named: Server Bluebird, Server Oceanview, Server Vortex, Server Crimsoncloud, Server Seabreeze, Server Ironbark, Server Ravenstone, Server Ghostwind, Server Thunderstrike, Server Glacier, Server Frostbite, Server Sunflower, Server Silverstone, Server Lighthouse, Server Blackwood, Server Stormcloud, Server Darkhorse, Server Twilight, Server Firefly, Server Stealthwind, Server Emberlight, Server Nightfall and Server Silverhawk. \nTo ensure network security, we need to install monitoring devices (such as firewalls or intrusion detection systems) on some of these computers so that all communication links are monitored. \nAssume that the connections between the computers (i.e., the communication links) are bidirectional. This means that information can flow in both directions across any link. Our goal is to deploy monitoring devices in a way that ensures all communication links are covered by at least one monitoring device. \nProblem: How can we select the minimum number of computers to deploy monitoring devices, such that every communication link is monitored by at least one device? \nCommunication links as follows: : \nServer Bluebird is connected with Server Ghostwind, Server Thunderstrike, Server Sunflower, Server Silverstone, Server Lighthouse, Server Blackwood, Server Stormcloud, Server Twilight, Server Firefly, Server Emberlight, Server Silverhawk. \nServer Oceanview is connected with Server Ravenstone, Server Thunderstrike, Server Sunflower, Server Silverstone, Server Blackwood, Server Darkhorse, Server Firefly, Server Emberlight. \nServer Vortex is connected with Server Crimsoncloud, Server Seabreeze, Server Ironbark, Server Ravenstone, Server Thunderstrike, Server Glacier, Server Frostbite, Server Silverstone, Server Blackwood, Server Stealthwind, Server Emberlight. \nServer Crimsoncloud is connected with Server Ironbark, Server Ravenstone, Server Thunderstrike, Server Glacier, Server Sunflower, Server Lighthouse, Server Silverhawk. \nServer Seabreeze is connected with Server Ghostwind, Server Thunderstrike, Server Frostbite, Server Silverstone, Server Lighthouse, Server Darkhorse, Server Silverhawk. \nServer Ironbark is connected with Server Ghostwind, Server Frostbite, Server Lighthouse, Server Stormcloud, Server Firefly, Server Stealthwind, Server Emberlight, Server Silverhawk. \nServer Ravenstone is connected with Server Ghostwind, Server Thunderstrike, Server Silverstone, Server Lighthouse, Server Darkhorse, Server Firefly. \nServer Ghostwind is connected with Server Thunderstrike, Server Frostbite, Server Sunflower, Server Silverstone, Server Lighthouse, Server Stormcloud, Server Twilight, Server Firefly, Server Emberlight, Server Nightfall, Server Silverhawk. \nServer Thunderstrike is connected with Server Stormcloud, Server Darkhorse, Server Twilight, Server Stealthwind. \nServer Glacier is connected with Server Frostbite, Server Stormcloud, Server Darkhorse, Server Twilight, Server Firefly, Server Stealthwind. \nServer Frostbite is connected with Server Lighthouse, Server Stormcloud, Server Darkhorse, Server Emberlight, Server Silverhawk. \nServer Sunflower is connected with Server Blackwood, Server Stormcloud, Server Emberlight. \nServer Silverstone is connected with Server Lighthouse, Server Darkhorse, Server Twilight, Server Nightfall. \nServer Lighthouse is connected with Server Firefly, Server Emberlight, Server Silverhawk. \nServer Blackwood is connected with Server Darkhorse, Server Twilight, Server Firefly, Server Emberlight, Server Silverhawk. \nServer Stormcloud is connected with Server Stealthwind. \nServer Darkhorse is connected with Server Silverhawk. \nServer Twilight is connected with Server Firefly, Server Emberlight. \nServer Stealthwind is connected with Server Emberlight. \nServer Emberlight is connected with Server Nightfall. \n",

  "Q": "Our company has 23 computers connected by several communication links. These computers are named: Server Silverstream, Server Emberlight, Server Blackwood, Server Solarflare, Server Frostbite, Server Silverstone, Server Sandstorm, Server Bluewave, Server Emberfall, Server Darkhorse, Server Firestorm, Server Frostmoon, Server Stormcloud, Server Eaglecrest, Server Glacierpeak, Server Silverhawk, Server Thunderbolt, Server Redwood, Server Glacier, Server Seabreeze, Server Mirage, Server Oceanview and Server Skyhawk. \nTo ensure network security, we need to install monitoring devices (such as firewalls or intrusion detection systems) on some of these computers so that all communication links are monitored. \nAssume that the connections between the computers (i.e., the communication links) are bidirectional. This means that information can flow in both directions across any link. Our goal is to deploy monitoring devices in a way that ensures all communication links are covered by at least one monitoring device. \nProblem: How can we select the minimum number of computers to deploy monitoring devices, such that every communication link is monitored by at least one device? \nCommunication links as follows: : \nServer Silverstream is connected with Server Solarflare, Server Silverstone, Server Emberfall, Server Darkhorse, Server Firestorm, Server Eaglecrest, Server Redwood, Server Oceanview, Server Skyhawk. \nServer Emberlight is connected with Server Blackwood, Server Frostbite, Server Bluewave, Server Emberfall, Server Eaglecrest, Server Silverhawk, Server Redwood, Server Seabreeze, Server Skyhawk. \nServer Blackwood is connected with Server Solarflare, Server Frostbite, Server Sandstorm, Server Bluewave, Server Stormcloud, Server Eaglecrest, Server Seabreeze, Server Mirage, Server Skyhawk. \nServer Solarflare is connected with Server Silverstone, Server Emberfall, Server Darkhorse, Server Eaglecrest, Server Glacierpeak, Server Thunderbolt, Server Redwood, Server Oceanview. \nServer Frostbite is connected with Server Sandstorm, Server Firestorm, Server Eaglecrest, Server Seabreeze. \nServer Silverstone is connected with Server Emberfall, Server Frostmoon, Server Redwood, Server Seabreeze, Server Mirage, Server Oceanview, Server Skyhawk. \nServer Sandstorm is connected with Server Bluewave, Server Emberfall, Server Darkhorse, Server Frostmoon, Server Glacierpeak, Server Thunderbolt, Server Glacier, Server Skyhawk. \nServer Bluewave is connected with Server Firestorm, Server Eaglecrest, Server Mirage, Server Oceanview, Server Skyhawk. \nServer Emberfall is connected with Server Firestorm, Server Frostmoon, Server Stormcloud, Server Glacierpeak, Server Thunderbolt, Server Glacier, Server Skyhawk. \nServer Darkhorse is connected with Server Thunderbolt, Server Redwood, Server Glacier, Server Oceanview. \nServer Firestorm is connected with Server Frostmoon, Server Silverhawk, Server Redwood, Server Seabreeze, Server Oceanview, Server Skyhawk. \nServer Frostmoon is connected with Server Stormcloud, Server Glacierpeak, Server Seabreeze. \nServer Stormcloud is connected with Server Glacierpeak, Server Silverhawk, Server Glacier, Server Seabreeze. \nServer Eaglecrest is connected with Server Glacierpeak, Server Thunderbolt, Server Glacier, Server Oceanview, Server Skyhawk. \nServer Glacierpeak is connected with Server Silverhawk, Server Thunderbolt, Server Seabreeze, Server Mirage, Server Oceanview, Server Skyhawk. \nServer Silverhawk is connected with Server Thunderbolt, Server Seabreeze, Server Mirage, Server Oceanview, Server Skyhawk. \nServer Thunderbolt is connected with Server Redwood, Server Seabreeze. \nServer Redwood is connected with Server Seabreeze. \nServer Glacier is connected with Server Oceanview. \nServer Mirage is connected with Server Oceanview. \nServer Oceanview is connected with Server Skyhawk. \n",

  "Q": "Our company has 23 computers connected by several communication links. These computers are named: Server Thunderstrike, Server Moonlight, Server Ironbark, Server Ghostwind, Server Seabreeze, Server Stormbreaker, Server Starfire, Server Stealthwind, Server Silverstream, Server Willowbrook, Server Windswept, Server Tempest, Server Thunderbolt, Server Mirage, Server Amberwave, Server Nightfall, Server Skyhawk, Server Falconeye, Server Goldleaf, Server Ironclad, Server Bluebird, Server Darkhorse and Server Lighthouse. \nTo ensure network security, we need to install monitoring devices (such as firewalls or intrusion detection systems) on some of these computers so that all communication links are monitored. \nAssume that the connections between the computers (i.e., the communication links) are bidirectional. This means that information can flow in both directions across any link. Our goal is to deploy monitoring devices in a way that ensures all communication links are covered by at least one monitoring device. \nProblem: How can we select the minimum number of computers to deploy monitoring devices, such that every communication link is monitored by at least one device? \nCommunication links as follows: : \nServer Thunderstrike is connected with Server Ghostwind, Server Silverstream, Server Windswept, Server Mirage, Server Amberwave, Server Nightfall, Server Skyhawk, Server Falconeye, Server Ironclad, Server Bluebird, Server Darkhorse, Server Lighthouse. \nServer Moonlight is connected with Server Ironbark, Server Ghostwind, Server Stormbreaker, Server Starfire, Server Windswept, Server Amberwave, Server Skyhawk, Server Falconeye, Server Goldleaf, Server Bluebird, Server Darkhorse, Server Lighthouse. \nServer Ironbark is connected with Server Stormbreaker, Server Willowbrook, Server Windswept, Server Thunderbolt, Server Mirage, Server Amberwave, Server Goldleaf. \nServer Ghostwind is connected with Server Seabreeze, Server Tempest, Server Mirage, Server Amberwave, Server Nightfall, Server Falconeye, Server Goldleaf, Server Ironclad, Server Bluebird, Server Darkhorse. \nServer Seabreeze is connected with Server Stormbreaker, Server Silverstream, Server Tempest, Server Thunderbolt, Server Amberwave, Server Falconeye. \nServer Stormbreaker is connected with Server Thunderbolt, Server Amberwave, Server Nightfall, Server Goldleaf, Server Lighthouse. \nServer Starfire is connected with Server Willowbrook, Server Windswept, Server Thunderbolt, Server Nightfall, Server Falconeye, Server Bluebird, Server Lighthouse. \nServer Stealthwind is connected with Server Willowbrook, Server Windswept, Server Tempest, Server Thunderbolt, Server Skyhawk, Server Goldleaf, Server Darkhorse. \nServer Silverstream is connected with Server Windswept, Server Tempest, Server Mirage, Server Falconeye, Server Ironclad, Server Lighthouse. \nServer Willowbrook is connected with Server Mirage, Server Amberwave, Server Lighthouse. \nServer Windswept is connected with Server Nightfall, Server Skyhawk, Server Ironclad, Server Darkhorse. \nServer Tempest is connected with Server Amberwave, Server Skyhawk, Server Ironclad, Server Lighthouse. \nServer Thunderbolt is connected with Server Nightfall, Server Ironclad, Server Bluebird. \nServer Mirage is connected with Server Amberwave, Server Goldleaf, Server Ironclad, Server Bluebird. \nServer Amberwave is connected with Server Goldleaf, Server Ironclad, Server Bluebird. \nServer Nightfall is connected with Server Darkhorse, Server Lighthouse. \nServer Skyhawk is connected with Server Falconeye, Server Darkhorse, Server Lighthouse. \nServer Falconeye is connected with Server Ironclad, Server Bluebird, Server Lighthouse. \nServer Goldleaf is connected with Server Ironclad, Server Lighthouse. \nServer Ironclad is connected with Server Bluebird. \nServer Bluebird is connected with Server Darkhorse. \n",

  "Q": "Our company has 23 computers connected by several communication links. These computers are named: Server Ravenstone, Server Silverstone, Server Vortex, Server Thunderstrike, Server Falconeye, Server Stealthwind, Server Glacierpeak, Server Amberwave, Server Redwood, Server Thunderbolt, Server Stormbreaker, Server Goldleaf, Server Bluewave, Server Firestorm, Server Blackwood, Server Shadowbrook, Server Nightshade, Server Lighthouse, Server Ghostwind, Server Windmill, Server Crimsoncloud, Server Twilight and Server Stormcloud. \nTo ensure network security, we need to install monitoring devices (such as firewalls or intrusion detection systems) on some of these computers so that all communication links are monitored. \nAssume that the connections between the computers (i.e., the communication links) are bidirectional. This means that information can flow in both directions across any link. Our goal is to deploy monitoring devices in a way that ensures all communication links are covered by at least one monitoring device. \nProblem: How can we select the minimum number of computers to deploy monitoring devices, such that every communication link is monitored by at least one device? \nCommunication links as follows: : \nServer Ravenstone is connected with Server Vortex, Server Thunderstrike, Server Falconeye, Server Stealthwind, Server Thunderbolt, Server Goldleaf, Server Bluewave, Server Blackwood, Server Shadowbrook, Server Nightshade, Server Lighthouse, Server Twilight, Server Stormcloud. \nServer Silverstone is connected with Server Thunderstrike, Server Glacierpeak, Server Amberwave, Server Redwood, Server Thunderbolt, Server Stormbreaker, Server Goldleaf, Server Windmill, Server Twilight. \nServer Vortex is connected with Server Falconeye, Server Thunderbolt, Server Bluewave, Server Blackwood, Server Windmill, Server Crimsoncloud, Server Stormcloud. \nServer Thunderstrike is connected with Server Stealthwind, Server Glacierpeak, Server Amberwave, Server Redwood, Server Goldleaf, Server Lighthouse, Server Ghostwind, Server Twilight. \nServer Falconeye is connected with Server Stealthwind, Server Goldleaf, Server Blackwood, Server Shadowbrook, Server Lighthouse, Server Ghostwind. \nServer Stealthwind is connected with Server Amberwave, Server Thunderbolt, Server Stormbreaker, Server Goldleaf, Server Bluewave, Server Shadowbrook. \nServer Glacierpeak is connected with Server Redwood, Server Thunderbolt, Server Stormbreaker, Server Blackwood, Server Lighthouse, Server Windmill. \nServer Amberwave is connected with Server Redwood, Server Thunderbolt, Server Stormbreaker, Server Goldleaf, Server Lighthouse, Server Windmill. \nServer Redwood is connected with Server Bluewave, Server Blackwood, Server Shadowbrook, Server Crimsoncloud, Server Stormcloud. \nServer Thunderbolt is connected with Server Stormbreaker, Server Goldleaf, Server Bluewave, Server Firestorm, Server Blackwood, Server Windmill, Server Crimsoncloud. \nServer Stormbreaker is connected with Server Bluewave, Server Crimsoncloud, Server Stormcloud. \nServer Goldleaf is connected with Server Bluewave, Server Blackwood, Server Nightshade, Server Ghostwind, Server Crimsoncloud. \nServer Bluewave is connected with Server Firestorm, Server Shadowbrook, Server Lighthouse, Server Ghostwind, Server Windmill, Server Crimsoncloud. \nServer Firestorm is connected with Server Windmill, Server Crimsoncloud. \nServer Blackwood is connected with Server Shadowbrook, Server Ghostwind, Server Windmill, Server Twilight. \nServer Shadowbrook is connected with Server Lighthouse. \nServer Nightshade is connected with Server Lighthouse, Server Ghostwind, Server Crimsoncloud, Server Stormcloud. \nServer Lighthouse is connected with Server Windmill, Server Crimsoncloud. \nServer Ghostwind is connected with Server Windmill, Server Crimsoncloud, Server Twilight, Server Stormcloud. \nServer Crimsoncloud is connected with Server Twilight. \n",

  "Q": "Our company has 23 computers connected by several communication links. These computers are named: Server Darkhorse, Server Thunderstrike, Server Silverstream, Server Tempest, Server Goldleaf, Server Blackwood, Server Crimsoncloud, Server Twilight, Server Vortex, Server Seabreeze, Server Bluewave, Server Emberlight, Server Starfire, Server Glacierpeak, Server Windswept, Server Lighthouse, Server Stormbreaker, Server Redwood, Server Glacier, Server Firestorm, Server Sandstorm, Server Mirage and Server Oceanview. \nTo ensure network security, we need to install monitoring devices (such as firewalls or intrusion detection systems) on some of these computers so that all communication links are monitored. \nAssume that the connections between the computers (i.e., the communication links) are bidirectional. This means that information can flow in both directions across any link. Our goal is to deploy monitoring devices in a way that ensures all communication links are covered by at least one monitoring device. \nProblem: How can we select the minimum number of computers to deploy monitoring devices, such that every communication link is monitored by at least one device? \nCommunication links as follows: : \nServer Darkhorse is connected with Server Silverstream, Server Tempest, Server Goldleaf, Server Blackwood, Server Vortex, Server Bluewave, Server Glacierpeak, Server Stormbreaker, Server Glacier, Server Sandstorm, Server Mirage. \nServer Thunderstrike is connected with Server Silverstream, Server Tempest, Server Goldleaf, Server Bluewave, Server Starfire, Server Windswept, Server Lighthouse, Server Stormbreaker, Server Redwood, Server Sandstorm, Server Mirage. \nServer Silverstream is connected with Server Blackwood, Server Twilight, Server Vortex, Server Emberlight, Server Glacierpeak, Server Windswept, Server Lighthouse, Server Oceanview. \nServer Tempest is connected with Server Blackwood, Server Crimsoncloud, Server Twilight, Server Vortex, Server Bluewave, Server Emberlight, Server Windswept, Server Mirage. \nServer Goldleaf is connected with Server Blackwood, Server Starfire, Server Stormbreaker, Server Redwood, Server Firestorm, Server Sandstorm. \nServer Blackwood is connected with Server Twilight, Server Vortex, Server Bluewave, Server Starfire, Server Windswept, Server Lighthouse, Server Redwood, Server Glacier, Server Sandstorm, Server Oceanview. \nServer Crimsoncloud is connected with Server Bluewave, Server Emberlight, Server Starfire, Server Glacier, Server Firestorm, Server Oceanview. \nServer Twilight is connected with Server Seabreeze, Server Starfire, Server Windswept, Server Glacier, Server Sandstorm. \nServer Vortex is connected with Server Seabreeze, Server Bluewave, Server Emberlight, Server Windswept. \nServer Seabreeze is connected with Server Starfire, Server Windswept, Server Lighthouse, Server Stormbreaker, Server Redwood. \nServer Bluewave is connected with Server Emberlight, Server Glacierpeak, Server Redwood, Server Sandstorm. \nServer Emberlight is connected with Server Starfire, Server Glacierpeak, Server Lighthouse, Server Sandstorm, Server Mirage. \nServer Starfire is connected with Server Glacierpeak, Server Windswept, Server Lighthouse, Server Redwood, Server Firestorm. \nServer Glacierpeak is connected with Server Glacier, Server Oceanview. \nServer Windswept is connected with Server Lighthouse, Server Redwood, Server Glacier. \nServer Lighthouse is connected with Server Stormbreaker, Server Glacier, Server Firestorm, Server Sandstorm, Server Mirage. \nServer Stormbreaker is connected with Server Firestorm, Server Mirage, Server Oceanview. \nServer Redwood is connected with Server Glacier. \nServer Glacier is connected with Server Sandstorm, Server Oceanview. \nServer Firestorm is connected with Server Oceanview. \n",

  "Q": "Our company has 23 computers connected by several communication links. These computers are named: Server Shadowbrook, Server Redwood, Server Stormbreaker, Server Windswept, Server Firefly, Server Glacierpeak, Server Firestorm, Server Nightshade, Server Twilight, Server Thunderbolt, Server Stormcloud, Server Stealthwind, Server Ironclad, Server Brightstar, Server Glacier, Server Skyhawk, Server Solarflare, Server Ironbark, Server Emberfall, Server Ravenstone, Server Thunderstrike, Server Crimsoncloud and Server Seabreeze. \nTo ensure network security, we need to install monitoring devices (such as firewalls or intrusion detection systems) on some of these computers so that all communication links are monitored. \nAssume that the connections between the computers (i.e., the communication links) are bidirectional. This means that information can flow in both directions across any link. Our goal is to deploy monitoring devices in a way that ensures all communication links are covered by at least one monitoring device. \nProblem: How can we select the minimum number of computers to deploy monitoring devices, such that every communication link is monitored by at least one device? \nCommunication links as follows: : \nServer Shadowbrook is connected with Server Redwood, Server Glacierpeak, Server Firestorm, Server Stormcloud, Server Ironclad, Server Brightstar, Server Glacier, Server Skyhawk, Server Crimsoncloud, Server Seabreeze. \nServer Redwood is connected with Server Stormbreaker, Server Thunderbolt, Server Stealthwind, Server Solarflare, Server Emberfall, Server Thunderstrike, Server Seabreeze. \nServer Stormbreaker is connected with Server Firefly, Server Glacierpeak, Server Firestorm, Server Nightshade, Server Ironclad, Server Glacier, Server Emberfall, Server Ravenstone, Server Thunderstrike, Server Seabreeze. \nServer Windswept is connected with Server Firestorm, Server Twilight, Server Stormcloud, Server Stealthwind, Server Ironclad, Server Brightstar, Server Emberfall, Server Ravenstone, Server Crimsoncloud, Server Seabreeze. \nServer Firefly is connected with Server Firestorm, Server Nightshade, Server Stealthwind, Server Solarflare, Server Ironbark, Server Ravenstone, Server Seabreeze. \nServer Glacierpeak is connected with Server Nightshade, Server Twilight, Server Stormcloud, Server Brightstar, Server Glacier, Server Solarflare, Server Ironbark, Server Emberfall, Server Thunderstrike, Server Crimsoncloud. \nServer Firestorm is connected with Server Thunderbolt, Server Stormcloud, Server Skyhawk, Server Solarflare, Server Ironbark, Server Crimsoncloud, Server Seabreeze. \nServer Nightshade is connected with Server Twilight, Server Thunderbolt, Server Stealthwind, Server Seabreeze. \nServer Twilight is connected with Server Thunderbolt, Server Stormcloud, Server Stealthwind, Server Solarflare, Server Emberfall, Server Thunderstrike, Server Crimsoncloud. \nServer Thunderbolt is connected with Server Ironclad, Server Glacier, Server Skyhawk, Server Ravenstone, Server Crimsoncloud. \nServer Stormcloud is connected with Server Ironclad, Server Ravenstone, Server Seabreeze. \nServer Stealthwind is connected with Server Ironclad, Server Ironbark, Server Emberfall, Server Ravenstone. \nServer Ironclad is connected with Server Brightstar, Server Glacier, Server Skyhawk. \nServer Brightstar is connected with Server Skyhawk, Server Solarflare, Server Emberfall. \nServer Glacier is connected with Server Ironbark, Server Crimsoncloud, Server Seabreeze. \nServer Skyhawk is connected with Server Solarflare, Server Emberfall, Server Seabreeze. \nServer Solarflare is connected with Server Ironbark, Server Emberfall, Server Crimsoncloud. \nServer Ironbark is connected with Server Crimsoncloud. \nServer Emberfall is connected with Server Crimsoncloud. \nServer Ravenstone is connected with Server Crimsoncloud, Server Seabreeze. \nServer Thunderstrike is connected with Server Seabreeze. \nServer Crimsoncloud is connected with Server Seabreeze. \n",
