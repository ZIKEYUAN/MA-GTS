  "Q": "Our company has 11 computers connected by several communication links. These computers are named: Server Eaglecrest, Server Starfire, Server Vortex, Server Amberwave, Server Oceanview, Server Falconeye, Server Emberlight, Server Sandstorm, Server Moonlight, Server Nightshade and Server Brightstar. \nTo ensure network security, we need to install monitoring devices (such as firewalls or intrusion detection systems) on some of these computers so that all communication links are monitored. \nAssume that the connections between the computers (i.e., the communication links) are bidirectional. This means that information can flow in both directions across any link. Our goal is to deploy monitoring devices in a way that ensures all communication links are covered by at least one monitoring device. \nProblem: How can we select the minimum number of computers to deploy monitoring devices, such that every communication link is monitored by at least one device? \nCommunication links as follows: : \nServer Eaglecrest is connected with Server Vortex, Server Oceanview, Server Sandstorm, Server Nightshade, Server Brightstar. \nServer Starfire is connected with Server Vortex, Server Moonlight, Server Nightshade. \nServer Vortex is connected with Server Amberwave, Server Oceanview, Server Falconeye, Server Moonlight, Server Brightstar. \nServer Amberwave is connected with Server Falconeye, Server Emberlight, Server Moonlight, Server Nightshade. \nServer Oceanview is connected with Server Moonlight. \nServer Falconeye is connected with Server Emberlight, Server Moonlight. \nServer Emberlight is connected with Server Moonlight, Server Nightshade. \nServer Sandstorm is connected with Server Moonlight, Server Brightstar. \n",
