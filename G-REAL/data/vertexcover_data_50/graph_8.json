  "Q": "Our company has 8 computers connected by several communication links. These computers are named: Server Eaglecrest, Server Vortex, Server Firestorm, Server Nightshade, Server Blackwood, Server Mirage, Server Stormcloud and Server Darkhorse. \nTo ensure network security, we need to install monitoring devices (such as firewalls or intrusion detection systems) on some of these computers so that all communication links are monitored. \nAssume that the connections between the computers (i.e., the communication links) are bidirectional. This means that information can flow in both directions across any link. Our goal is to deploy monitoring devices in a way that ensures all communication links are covered by at least one monitoring device. \nProblem: How can we select the minimum number of computers to deploy monitoring devices, such that every communication link is monitored by at least one device? \nCommunication links as follows: : \nServer Eaglecrest is connected with Server Vortex, Server Mirage. \nServer Vortex is connected with Server Firestorm, Server Mirage. \nServer Firestorm is connected with Server Nightshade, Server Blackwood, Server Darkhorse. \nServer Nightshade is connected with Server Blackwood, Server Mirage. \nServer Blackwood is connected with Server Mirage, Server Stormcloud. \nServer Mirage is connected with Server Darkhorse. \n",
