This algorithm is efficient for graphs with thousands of nodes and operates in linear time.\n\n4. **Parameters**:\n   - The algorithm requires the following parameters:\n     - `adjacency_list`: The representation of the undirected graph.\n     - `start_node`: The node from which the search begins (can be any node, typically node 0).\n   \n5. **Complexity**:\n   - The time complexity of the selected algorithm is **O(n + m)**, where `n` is the number of vertices (nodes) and `m` is the number of edges. This indicates that the algorithm runs efficiently in linear time relative to the size of the graph.\n\n6. **Description**:\n   - The DFS-based cycle detection algorithm is the best choice for this problem because it efficiently traverses the graph while maintaining a recursion stack to detect back edges, which indicate the presence of cycles. Given the size of the graph, this method will provide a quick and effective solution.\n\nHere is the output in the requested dictionary format:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"problem\": \"Determine if there is a cycle in the undirected graph\",\n    \"algorithm\": \"Cycle Detection using Depth-First Search (DFS)\",\n    \"parameters\": {\n        \"adjacency_list\": \"An undirected graph represented as an adjacency list.\",\n        \"start_node\": \"The node from which the search begins.\"\n    },\n    \"complexity\": \"O(n + m), where n is the number of vertices and m is the number of edges.\",\n    \"description\": \"The DFS-based cycle detection algorithm is efficient for large graphs and effectively identifies cycles by checking for back edges during traversal.\"\n}\n```"
