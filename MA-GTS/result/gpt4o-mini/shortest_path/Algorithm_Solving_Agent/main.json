The graph is represented as an adjacency list, and the specific nodes of interest are node 3 (the starting node) and node 2 (the destination node).\n\n### Algorithm Used\nDijkstra's Algorithm was chosen for this problem due to its efficiency in finding the shortest path in graphs with weighted edges. The algorithm operates with a time complexity of \\(O((n + m) \\log n)\\), where \\(n\\) is the number of vertices and \\(m\\) is the number of edges.\n\n### Tool's Output\nThe output from the Dijkstra's algorithm indicates that the shortest path from node 3 to node 2 is:\n- **Path**: [3, 7, 10, 14, 17, 2]\n- **Total Weight**: 33\n\n### Final Answer Analysis\nUsing the node mapping provided, we can confirm that:\n- Starting Node: 3\n- Ending Node: 2\n\nThe path taken is:\n1. From node 3 to node 7\n2. From node 7 to node 10\n3. From node 10 to node 14\n4. From node 14 to node 17\n5. Finally, from node 17 to node 2\n\nThe total weight of this path is 33, which represents the cumulative weight of the edges traversed.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe shortest path from node 3 to node 2 is through nodes 7, 10, 14, and 17, with a total weight of 33."
