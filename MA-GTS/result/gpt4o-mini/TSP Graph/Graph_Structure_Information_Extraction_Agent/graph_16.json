Since there are 16 nodes, we will list them all:\n\n```python\nnodes = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]\n```\n\n### 2. Edges\nNext, we will list all edges as tuples. Each edge connects two nodes and has an associated distance (weight). Given the large number of edges, we will group them logically by the starting node for clarity.\n\n#### Grouping by Starting Node:\n- **From Node 0**:\n    - (0, 1, {\"weight\": 1})\n    - (0, 2, {\"weight\": 5})\n    - (0, 3, {\"weight\": 5})\n    - (0, 4, {\"weight\": 4})\n    - (0, 5, {\"weight\": 5})\n    - (0, 6, {\"weight\": 4})\n    - (0, 7, {\"weight\": 2})\n    - (0, 8, {\"weight\": 4})\n    - (0, 9, {\"weight\": 5})\n    - (0, 10, {\"weight\": 4})\n    - (0, 11, {\"weight\": 2})\n    - (0, 12, {\"weight\": 3})\n    - (0, 13, {\"weight\": 3})\n    - (0, 14, {\"weight\": 1})\n    - (0, 15, {\"weight\": 1})\n\n- **From Node 1**:\n    - (1, 2, {\"weight\": 2})\n    - (1, 3, {\"weight\": 2})\n    - (1, 4, {\"weight\": 1})\n    - (1, 5, {\"weight\": 5})\n    - (1, 6, {\"weight\": 1})\n    - (1, 7, {\"weight\": 1})\n    - (1, 8, {\"weight\": 2})\n    - (1, 9, {\"weight\": 4})\n    - (1, 10, {\"weight\": 3})\n    - (1, 11, {\"weight\": 1})\n    - (1, 12, {\"weight\": 1})\n    - (1, 13, {\"weight\": 3})\n    - (1, 14, {\"weight\": 1})\n    - (1, 15, {\"weight\": 5})\n\n- **From Node 2**:\n    - (2, 3, {\"weight\": 3})\n    - (2, 4, {\"weight\": 1})\n    - (2, 5, {\"weight\": 4})\n    - (2, 6, {\"weight\": 3})\n    - (2, 7, {\"weight\": 5})\n    - (2, 8, {\"weight\": 4})\n    - (2, 9, {\"weight\": 2})\n    - (2, 10, {\"weight\": 1})\n    - (2, 11, {\"weight\": 5})\n    - (2, 12, {\"weight\": 3})\n    - (2, 13, {\"weight\": 3})\n    - (2, 14, {\"weight\": 2})\n    - (2, 15, {\"weight\": 5})\n\n- **From Node 3**:\n    - (3, 4, {\"weight\": 2})\n    - (3, 5, {\"weight\": 1})\n    - (3, 6, {\"weight\": 5})\n    - (3, 7, {\"weight\": 4})\n    - (3, 8, {\"weight\": 4})\n    - (3, 9, {\"weight\": 3})\n    - (3, 10, {\"weight\": 1})\n    - (3, 11, {\"weight\": 3})\n    - (3, 12, {\"weight\": 5})\n    - (3, 13, {\"weight\": 5})\n    - (3, 14, {\"weight\": 2})\n    - (3, 15, {\"weight\": 4})\n\n- **From Node 4**:\n    - (4, 5, {\"weight\": 3})\n    - (4, 6, {\"weight\": 2})\n    - (4, 7, {\"weight\": 2})\n    - (4, 8, {\"weight\": 3})\n    - (4, 9, {\"weight\": 1})\n    - (4, 10, {\"weight\": 4})\n    - (4, 11, {\"weight\": 3})\n    - (4, 12, {\"weight\": 2})\n    - (4, 13, {\"weight\": 5})\n    - (4, 14, {\"weight\": 4})\n    - (4, 15, {\"weight\": 5})\n\n- **From Node 5**:\n    - (5, 6, {\"weight\": 3})\n    - (5, 7, {\"weight\": 4})\n    - (5, 8, {\"weight\": 4})\n    - (5, 9, {\"weight\": 3})\n    - (5, 10, {\"weight\": 3})\n    - (5, 11, {\"weight\": 1})\n    - (5, 12, {\"weight\": 2})\n    - (5, 13, {\"weight\": 2})\n    - (5, 14, {\"weight\": 4})\n    - (5, 15, {\"weight\": 5})\n\n- **From Node 6**:\n    - (6, 7, {\"weight\": 3})\n    - (6, 8, {\"weight\": 5})\n    - (6, 9, {\"weight\": 2})\n    - (6, 10, {\"weight\": 1})\n    - (6, 11, {\"weight\": 3})\n    - (6, 12, {\"weight\": 2})\n    - (6, 13, {\"weight\": 3})\n    - (6, 14, {\"weight\": 4})\n    - (6, 15, {\"weight\": 5})\n\n- **From Node 7**:\n    - (7, 8, {\"weight\": 2})\n    - (7, 9, {\"weight\": 5})\n    - (7, 10, {\"weight\": 5})\n    - (7, 11, {\"weight\": 5})\n    - (7, 12, {\"weight\": 3})\n    - (7, 13, {\"weight\": 5})\n    - (7, 14, {\"weight\": 3})\n    - (7, 15, {\"weight\": 4})\n\n- **From Node 8**:\n    - (8, 9, {\"weight\": 4})\n    - (8, 10, {\"weight\": 5})\n    - (8, 11, {\"weight\": 2})\n    - (8, 12, {\"weight\": 4})\n    - (8, 13, {\"weight\": 1})\n    - (8, 14, {\"weight\": 3})\n    - (8, 15, {\"weight\": 2})\n\n- **From Node 9**:\n    - (9, 10, {\"weight\": 3})\n    - (9, 11, {\"weight\": 5})\n    - (9, 12, {\"weight\": 5})\n    - (9, 13, {\"weight\": 4})\n    - (9, 14, {\"weight\": 5})\n    - (9, 15, {\"weight\": 2})\n\n- **From Node 10**:\n    - (10, 11, {\"weight\": 1})\n    - (10, 12, {\"weight\": 5})\n    - (10, 13, {\"weight\": 4})\n    - (10, 14, {\"weight\": 2})\n    - (10, 15, {\"weight\": 5})\n\n- **From Node 11**:\n    - (11, 12, {\"weight\": 3})\n    - (11, 13, {\"weight\": 1})\n    - (11, 14, {\"weight\": 2})\n    - (11, 15, {\"weight\": 3})\n\n- **From Node 12**:\n    - (12, 13, {\"weight\": 4})\n    - (12, 14, {\"weight\": 5})\n    - (12, 15, {\"weight\": 5})\n\n- **From Node 13**:\n    - (13, 14, {\"weight\": 3})\n    - (13, 15, {\"weight\": 4})\n\n- **From Node 14**:\n    - (14, 15, {\"weight\": 4})\n\n### 3.
