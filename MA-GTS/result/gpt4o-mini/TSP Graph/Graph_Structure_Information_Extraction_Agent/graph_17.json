  "response": "To extract the graph structure information from the provided problem, we will follow the steps outlined:\n\n1. **Nodes**: The graph consists of nodes labeled from 0 to 16. Since there are 17 nodes in total, we will list them all.\n\n2. **Edges**: The edges will be extracted as tuples containing the two connected nodes and the distance as an attribute. Given the large number of edges, we will group them logically by the starting node for clarity.\n\n3. **Graph Type**: The graph is undirected, as specified.\n\nHere is the extracted information:\n\n```python\n{\n    \"nodes\": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16],\n    \"edges\": [\n        #
