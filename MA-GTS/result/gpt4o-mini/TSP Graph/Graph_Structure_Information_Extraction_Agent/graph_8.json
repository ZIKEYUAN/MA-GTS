  "response": "To extract the graph structure information from the provided problem, we will follow the outlined steps:\n\n1. **Nodes**: The nodes in the graph are numbered from 0 to 7. Therefore, we have the following nodes:\n   - Nodes: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]\n\n2. **Edges**: The edges are connections between the nodes with their respective distances. We will list them as tuples, where each tuple contains two nodes and a dictionary with the distance as an attribute. \n\n   The edges are as follows:\n   - From node 0: \n     - (0, 1, {\"distance\": 3})\n     - (0, 2, {\"distance\": 4})\n     - (0, 3, {\"distance\": 1})\n     - (0, 4, {\"distance\": 3})\n     - (0, 5, {\"distance\": 5})\n     - (0, 6, {\"distance\": 5})\n     - (0, 7, {\"distance\": 4})\n   - From node 1:\n     - (1, 2, {\"distance\": 5})\n     - (1, 3, {\"distance\": 4})\n     - (1, 4, {\"distance\": 4})\n     - (1, 5, {\"distance\": 2})\n     - (1, 6, {\"distance\": 3})\n     - (1, 7, {\"distance\": 5})\n   - From node 2:\n     - (2, 3, {\"distance\": 1})\n     - (2, 4, {\"distance\": 2})\n     - (2, 5, {\"distance\": 2})\n     - (2, 6, {\"distance\": 4})\n     - (2, 7, {\"distance\": 5})\n   - From node 3:\n     - (3, 4, {\"distance\": 3})\n     - (3, 5, {\"distance\": 4})\n     - (3, 6, {\"distance\": 2})\n     - (3, 7, {\"distance\": 1})\n   - From node 4:\n     - (4, 5, {\"distance\": 1})\n     - (4, 6, {\"distance\": 5})\n     - (4, 7, {\"distance\": 3})\n   - From node 5:\n     - (5, 6, {\"distance\": 2})\n     - (5, 7, {\"distance\": 2})\n   - From node 6:\n     - (6, 7, {\"distance\": 4})\n\n   We will compile all edges into a single list:\n   ```python\n   edges = [\n       (0, 1, {\"distance\": 3}),\n       (0, 2, {\"distance\": 4}),\n       (0, 3, {\"distance\": 1}),\n       (0, 4, {\"distance\": 3}),\n       (0, 5, {\"distance\": 5}),\n       (0, 6, {\"distance\": 5}),\n       (0, 7, {\"distance\": 4}),\n       (1, 2, {\"distance\": 5}),\n       (1, 3, {\"distance\": 4}),\n       (1, 4, {\"distance\": 4}),\n       (1, 5, {\"distance\": 2}),\n       (1, 6, {\"distance\": 3}),\n       (1, 7, {\"distance\": 5}),\n       (2, 3, {\"distance\": 1}),\n       (2, 4, {\"distance\": 2}),\n       (2, 5, {\"distance\": 2}),\n       (2, 6, {\"distance\": 4}),\n       (2, 7, {\"distance\": 5}),\n       (3, 4, {\"distance\": 3}),\n       (3, 5, {\"distance\": 4}),\n       (3, 6, {\"distance\": 2}),\n       (3, 7, {\"distance\": 1}),\n       (4, 5, {\"distance\": 1}),\n       (4, 6, {\"distance\": 5}),\n       (4, 7, {\"distance\": 3}),\n       (5, 6, {\"distance\": 2}),\n       (5, 7, {\"distance\": 2}),\n       (6, 7, {\"distance\": 4}),\n   ]\n   ```\n\n3. **Graph Type**: The graph is undirected, as specified in the problem statement.\n\nNow, we can compile this information into the required dictionary format:\n\n```python\n{\n    \"nodes\": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7],\n    \"edges\": [\n        (0, 1, {\"distance\": 3}),\n        (0, 2, {\"distance\": 4}),\n        (0, 3, {\"distance\": 1}),\n        (0, 4, {\"distance\": 3}),\n        (0, 5, {\"distance\": 5}),\n        (0, 6, {\"distance\": 5}),\n        (0, 7, {\"distance\": 4}),\n        (1, 2, {\"distance\": 5}),\n        (1, 3, {\"distance\": 4}),\n        (1, 4, {\"distance\": 4}),\n        (1, 5, {\"distance\": 2}),\n        (1, 6, {\"distance\": 3}),\n        (1, 7, {\"distance\": 5}),\n        (2, 3, {\"distance\": 1}),\n        (2, 4, {\"distance\": 2}),\n        (2, 5, {\"distance\": 2}),\n        (2, 6, {\"distance\": 4}),\n        (2, 7, {\"distance\": 5}),\n        (3, 4, {\"distance\": 3}),\n        (3, 5, {\"distance\": 4}),\n        (3, 6, {\"distance\": 2}),\n        (3, 7, {\"distance\": 1}),\n        (4, 5, {\"distance\": 1}),\n        (4, 6, {\"distance\": 5}),\n        (4, 7, {\"distance\": 3}),\n        (5, 6, {\"distance\": 2}),\n        (5, 7, {\"distance\": 2}),\n        (6, 7, {\"distance\": 4}),\n    ],\n    \"graph_type\": \"undirected\"\n}\n```"
