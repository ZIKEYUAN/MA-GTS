  "response": "To extract the graph structure information from the provided problem, we will follow the outlined steps:\n\n### 1. Nodes\nThe graph consists of nodes labeled from 0 to 18. Since there are 19 nodes in total, we will list them directly:\n\n```python\nnodes = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18]\n```\n\n### 2. Edges\nThe edges are connections between the nodes with specified distances. We will list them as tuples, where each tuple contains two connected nodes and a dictionary with the distance as an attribute.\n\nGiven the large number of edges, we will group them logically by the starting node for clarity. Each group will contain edges originating from the same node.\n\n```python\nedges = [\n    (0, 1, {\"distance\": 4}),\n    (0, 2, {\"distance\": 3}),\n    (0, 3, {\"distance\": 4}),\n    (0, 4,
