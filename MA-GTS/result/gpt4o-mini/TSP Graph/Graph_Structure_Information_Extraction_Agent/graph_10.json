  "response": "To extract the graph structure information from the provided problem, we will follow the outlined steps:\n\n1. **Nodes**: The graph consists of nodes labeled from 0 to 9. Since there are 10 nodes, we will list them all.\n\n2. **Edges**: The edges will be listed as tuples, including the distance as an attribute. Given the number of edges is substantial, we will group them logically by the starting node for clarity.\n\n3. **Graph Type**: The graph is undirected, as specified in the problem statement.\n\nHere is the extracted information in the required format:\n\n```python\n{\n    \"nodes\": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9],\n    \"edges\": [\n        (0, 1, {\"distance\": 5}),\n        (0, 2, {\"distance\": 5}),\n        (0, 3, {\"distance\": 4}),\n        (0, 4, {\"distance\": 3}),\n        (0, 5, {\"distance\": 2}),\n        (0, 6, {\"distance\": 5}),\n        (0, 7, {\"distance\": 2}),\n        (0, 8, {\"distance\": 4}),\n        (0, 9, {\"distance\": 4}),\n        (1, 2, {\"distance\": 2}),\n        (1, 3, {\"distance\": 2}),\n        (1, 4, {\"distance\": 1}),\n        (1, 5, {\"distance\": 5}),\n        (1, 6, {\"distance\": 1}),\n        (1, 7, {\"distance\": 4}),\n        (1, 8, {\"distance\": 2}),\n        (1, 9, {\"distance\": 4}),\n        (2, 3, {\"distance\": 1}),\n        (2, 4, {\"distance\": 3}),\n        (2, 5, {\"distance\": 1}),\n        (2, 6, {\"distance\": 1}),\n        (2, 7, {\"distance\": 3}),\n        (2, 8, {\"distance\": 1}),\n        (2, 9, {\"distance\": 1}),\n        (3, 4, {\"distance\": 5}),\n        (3, 5, {\"distance\": 3}),\n        (3, 6, {\"distance\": 4}),\n        (3, 7, {\"distance\": 1}),\n        (3, 8, {\"distance\": 4}),\n        (3, 9, {\"distance\": 1}),\n        (4, 5, {\"distance\": 3}),\n        (4, 6, {\"distance\": 3}),\n        (4, 7, {\"distance\": 2}),\n        (4, 8, {\"distance\": 5}),\n        (4, 9, {\"distance\": 1}),\n        (5, 6, {\"distance\": 1}),\n        (5, 7, {\"distance\": 5}),\n        (5, 8, {\"distance\": 1}),\n        (5, 9, {\"distance\": 2}),\n        (6, 7, {\"distance\": 1}),\n        (6, 8, {\"distance\": 4}),\n        (6, 9, {\"distance\": 1}),\n        (7, 8, {\"distance\": 4}),\n        (7, 9, {\"distance\": 3}),\n        (8, 9, {\"distance\": 4})\n    ],\n    \"graph_type\": \"undirected\"\n}\n```\n\nThis output provides a complete and concise representation of the graph structure, including all nodes and edges with their respective distances."
