  "response": "To extract the graph structure information from the provided problem, we will identify the nodes, edges, and the type of graph.\n\n### Nodes\nThe graph consists of nodes numbered from 0 to 22. Therefore, the list of nodes is:\n```python\nnodes = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22]\n```\n\n### Edges\nThe edges are defined by the connections between nodes along with their distances. Given the large number of edges, we will group them by the starting node for clarity. Each edge is represented as a tuple of the form `(node_a, node_b, {\"weight\": distance})`.\n\n#### Grouping by Starting Node\nHere are the edges grouped by their starting node:\n\n- **From Node

  "response": "To extract the graph structure information from the provided problem, we will identify the nodes and edges based on the given connections and distances. \n\n### Nodes\nThe graph consists of nodes numbered from 0 to 22. Therefore, the nodes can be listed as follows:\n\n```python\nnodes = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22]\n```\n\n### Edges\nThe edges are defined by the connections between nodes along with their distances. Given the large number of edges, we will group them by the starting node for clarity. Each edge will be represented as a tuple containing the two connected nodes and the distance as an attribute.\n\n#### Grouping by Starting Node\nHere are the edges grouped by their starting

Therefore, the list of nodes is:\n```python\nnodes = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22]\n```\n\n### 2.
