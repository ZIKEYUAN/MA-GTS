Therefore, we can list them as follows:\n\n```python\nnodes = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]\n```\n\n### 2. Edges\nNext, we will list the edges as tuples. Each edge connects two nodes and has an associated distance. Given the number of edges is quite large, we will group them logically by the starting node for clarity.\n\n#### Edges grouped by starting node:\n- From node 0:\n    - (0, 1, {\"distance\": 2})\n    - (0, 2, {\"distance\": 1})\n    - (0, 3, {\"distance\": 4})\n    - (0, 4, {\"distance\": 2})\n    - (0, 5, {\"distance\": 3})\n    - (0, 6, {\"distance\": 4})\n    - (0, 7, {\"distance\": 1})\n    - (0, 8, {\"distance\": 3})\n    - (0, 9, {\"distance\": 3})\n    - (0, 10, {\"distance\": 3})\n    - (0, 11, {\"distance\": 5})\n    - (0, 12, {\"distance\": 4})\n    - (0, 13, {\"distance\": 5})\n\n- From node 1:\n    - (1, 2, {\"distance\": 3})\n    - (1, 3, {\"distance\": 5})\n    - (1, 4, {\"distance\": 5})\n    - (1, 5, {\"distance\": 1})\n    - (1, 6, {\"distance\": 4})\n    - (1, 7, {\"distance\": 1})\n    - (1, 8, {\"distance\": 1})\n    - (1, 9, {\"distance\": 1})\n    - (1, 10, {\"distance\": 2})\n    - (1, 11, {\"distance\": 1})\n    - (1, 12, {\"distance\": 3})\n    - (1, 13, {\"distance\": 2})\n\n- From node 2:\n    - (2, 3, {\"distance\": 4})\n    - (2, 4, {\"distance\": 3})\n    - (2, 5, {\"distance\": 4})\n    - (2, 6, {\"distance\": 2})\n    - (2, 7, {\"distance\": 4})\n    - (2, 8, {\"distance\": 5})\n    - (2, 9, {\"distance\": 3})\n    - (2, 10, {\"distance\": 5})\n    - (2, 11, {\"distance\": 2})\n    - (2, 12, {\"distance\": 4})\n    - (2, 13, {\"distance\": 4})\n\n- From node 3:\n    - (3, 4, {\"distance\": 1})\n    - (3, 5, {\"distance\": 2})\n    - (3, 6, {\"distance\": 5})\n    - (3, 7, {\"distance\": 1})\n    - (3, 8, {\"distance\": 2})\n    - (3, 9, {\"distance\": 5})\n    - (3, 10, {\"distance\": 5})\n    - (3, 11, {\"distance\": 1})\n    - (3, 12, {\"distance\": 5})\n    - (3, 13, {\"distance\": 2})\n\n- From node 4:\n    - (4, 5, {\"distance\": 5})\n    - (4, 6, {\"distance\": 5})\n    - (4, 7, {\"distance\": 2})\n    - (4, 8, {\"distance\": 1})\n    - (4, 9, {\"distance\": 5})\n    - (4, 10, {\"distance\": 4})\n    - (4, 11, {\"distance\": 4})\n    - (4, 12, {\"distance\": 2})\n    - (4, 13, {\"distance\": 1})\n\n- From node 5:\n    - (5, 6, {\"distance\": 3})\n    - (5, 7, {\"distance\": 4})\n    - (5, 8, {\"distance\": 3})\n    - (5, 9, {\"distance\": 2})\n    - (5, 10, {\"distance\": 3})\n    - (5, 11, {\"distance\": 4})\n    - (5, 12, {\"distance\": 3})\n    - (5, 13, {\"distance\": 4})\n\n- From node 6:\n    - (6, 7, {\"distance\": 1})\n    - (6, 8, {\"distance\": 5})\n    - (6, 9, {\"distance\": 5})\n    - (6, 10, {\"distance\": 2})\n    - (6, 11, {\"distance\": 5})\n    - (6, 12, {\"distance\": 3})\n    - (6, 13, {\"distance\": 4})\n\n- From node 7:\n    - (7, 8, {\"distance\": 4})\n    - (7, 9, {\"distance\": 5})\n    - (7, 10, {\"distance\": 2})\n    - (7, 11, {\"distance\": 5})\n    - (7, 12, {\"distance\": 2})\n    - (7, 13, {\"distance\": 2})\n\n- From node 8:\n    - (8, 9, {\"distance\": 5})\n    - (8, 10, {\"distance\": 1})\n    - (8, 11, {\"distance\": 1})\n    - (8, 12, {\"distance\": 3})\n    - (8, 13, {\"distance\": 5})\n\n- From node 9:\n    - (9, 10, {\"distance\": 3})\n    - (9, 11, {\"distance\": 2})\n    - (9, 12, {\"distance\": 1})\n    - (9, 13, {\"distance\": 1})\n\n- From node 10:\n    - (10, 11, {\"distance\": 1})\n    - (10, 12, {\"distance\": 4})\n    - (10, 13, {\"distance\": 2})\n\n- From node 11:\n    - (11, 12, {\"distance\": 4})\n    - (11, 13, {\"distance\": 2})\n\n- From node 12:\n    - (12, 13, {\"distance\": 5})\n\n### 3. Graph Type\nThe graph is undirected and weighted, as it has edges with distances.\n\n### Final Output\nNow we can compile this information into the required dictionary format:\n\n```python\ngraph_info = {\n    \"nodes\": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13],\n    \"edges\": [\n        (0, 1, {\"distance\": 2}),\n        (0, 2, {\"distance\": 1}),\n        (0, 3, {\"distance\": 4}),\n        (0, 4, {\"distance\": 2}),\n        (0, 5, {\"distance\": 3}),\n        (0, 6, {\"distance\": 4}),\n        (0, 7, {\"distance\": 1}),\n        (0, 8, {\"distance\": 3}),\n        (0, 9, {\"distance\": 3}),\n        (0, 10, {\"distance\": 3}),\n        (0, 11, {\"distance\": 5}),\n        (0, 12, {\"distance\": 4}),\n        (0, 13, {\"distance\": 5}),\n        (1, 2, {\"distance\": 3}),\n        (1, 3, {\"distance\": 5}),\n        (1, 4, {\"distance\": 5}),\n        (1, 5, {\"distance\": 1}),\n        (1, 6, {\"distance\": 4}),\n        (1, 7, {\"distance\": 1}),\n        (1, 8, {\"distance\": 1}),\n        (1, 9, {\"distance\": 1}),\n        (1, 10, {\"distance\": 2}),\n        (1, 11, {\"distance\": 1}),\n        (1, 12, {\"distance\": 3}),\n        (1, 13, {\"distance\": 2}),\n        (2, 3, {\"distance\": 4}),\n        (2, 4, {\"distance\": 3}),\n        (2, 5, {\"distance\": 4}),\n        (2, 6, {\"distance\": 2}),\n        (2, 7, {\"distance\": 4}),\n        (2, 8, {\"distance\": 5}),\n        (2, 9, {\"distance\": 3}),\n        (2, 10, {\"distance\": 5}),\n        (2, 11, {\"distance\": 2}),\n        (2, 12, {\"distance\": 4}),\n        (2, 13, {\"distance\": 4}),\n        (3, 4, {\"distance\": 1}),\n        (3, 5, {\"distance\": 2}),\n        (3, 6, {\"distance\": 5}),\n        (3, 7, {\"distance\": 1}),\n        (3, 8, {\"distance\": 2}),\n        (3, 9, {\"distance\": 5}),\n        (3, 10, {\"distance\": 5}),\n        (3, 11, {\"distance\": 1}),\n        (3, 12, {\"distance\": 5}),\n        (3, 13, {\"distance\": 2}),\n        (4, 5, {\"distance\": 5}),\n        (4, 6, {\"distance\": 5}),\n        (4, 7, {\"distance\": 2}),\n        (4, 8, {\"distance\": 1}),\n        (4, 9, {\"distance\": 5}),\n        (4, 10, {\"distance\": 4}),\n        (4, 11, {\"distance\": 4}),\n        (4, 12, {\"distance\": 2}),\n        (4, 13, {\"distance\": 1}),\n        (5, 6, {\"distance\": 3}),\n        (5, 7, {\"distance\": 4}),\n        (5, 8, {\"distance\": 3}),\n        (5, 9, {\"distance\": 2}),\n        (5, 10, {\"distance\": 3}),\n        (5, 11, {\"distance\": 4}),\n        (5, 12, {\"distance\": 3}),\n        (5, 13, {\"distance\": 4}),\n        (6, 7, {\"distance\": 1}),\n        (6, 8, {\"distance\": 5}),\n        (6, 9, {\"distance\": 5}),\n        (6, 10, {\"distance\": 2}),\n        (6, 11, {\"distance\": 5}),\n        (6, 12, {\"distance\": 3}),\n        (6, 13, {\"distance\": 4}),\n        (7, 8, {\"distance\": 4}),\n        (7, 9, {\"distance\": 5}),\n        (7, 10, {\"distance\": 2}),\n        (7, 11, {\"distance\": 5}),\n        (7, 12, {\"distance\": 2}),\n        (7, 13, {\"distance\": 2}),\n        (8, 9, {\"distance\": 5}),\n        (8, 10, {\"distance\": 1}),\n        (8, 11, {\"distance\": 1}),\n        (8, 12, {\"distance\": 3}),\n        (8, 13, {\"distance\": 5}),\n        (9, 10, {\"distance\": 3}),\n        (9, 11, {\"distance\": 2}),\n        (9, 12, {\"distance\": 1}),\n        (9, 13, {\"distance\": 1}),\n        (10, 11, {\"distance\": 1}),\n        (10, 12, {\"distance\": 4}),\n        (10, 13, {\"distance\": 2}),\n        (11, 12, {\"distance\": 4}),\n        (11, 13, {\"distance\": 2}),\n        (12, 13, {\"distance\": 5}),\n    ],\n    \"graph_type\": \"undirected, weighted\"\n}\n```\n\nThis dictionary contains all the necessary information about the graph structure, including nodes, edges, and the type of graph."
