Therefore, the nodes can be listed as follows:\n\n```python\nnodes = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]\n```\n\n### 2. Edges\nThe edges are defined by the connections between nodes along with their distances. Given the large number of edges, we will group them by the starting node for clarity.
