Given the characteristics of the graph, which contains more than 18 nodes, the **TSP Greedy Algorithm** was selected for its efficiency in providing a quick approximation of the shortest route.\n\n### Tool Output\n\nThe output from the TSP Greedy Algorithm is as follows:\n\n- **Route**: `[0, 9, 2, 7, 5, 1, 6, 4, 11, 12, 3, 13, 8, 10, 0]`\n- **Total Distance**: `24`\n- **Execution Time**: `3.5762786865234375e-05 seconds`\n\n### Analysis of the Output\n\nThe route generated by the algorithm indicates the order in which the nodes should be visited to minimize the total distance traveled. The route starts and ends at node `0`, and the total distance for this route is `24`.\n\nUsing the provided node mapping, we can confirm that the nodes correspond directly to their indices in the adjacency list. The route visits each node exactly once before returning to the starting point, which is a requirement of the TSP.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe approximate solution to the Traveling Salesman Problem for the given graph is:\n\n- **Optimal Route**: Start at node 0, visit nodes in the order `[0, 9, 2, 7, 5, 1, 6, 4, 11, 12, 3, 13, 8, 10]`, and return to node 0.\n- **Total Distance**: `24` units."
