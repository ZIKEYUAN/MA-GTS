Given the characteristics of the graph and the problem type, the **TSP Greedy Nearest Neighbor Algorithm** was selected for solving this problem. This algorithm is suitable for providing an approximate solution to the TSP, especially when the number of nodes is not explicitly defined but assumed to be manageable.\n\n### Tool's Output\n\nThe output from the TSP Greedy Nearest Neighbor Algorithm is as follows:\n\n- **Route**: `[0, 3, 5, 1, 4, 7, 6, 8, 9, 2, 0]`\n- **Total Distance**: `15`\n- **Execution Time**: `2.384185791015625e-05 seconds`\n\n### Analysis of the Output\n\nThe route `[0, 3, 5, 1, 4, 7, 6, 8, 9, 2, 0]` indicates the order in which the nodes are visited, starting and ending at node `0`. The total distance of this route is `15`, which represents the sum of the weights of the edges traversed in this path.\n\nUsing the provided **node mapping**, we can confirm that the nodes correspond directly to their indices in the adjacency list, meaning that the route is valid within the context of the graph structure.\n\n### Final Answer\n\nThe approximate solution to the Traveling Salesman Problem for the given graph is:\n\n- **Optimal Route**: Start at node `0`, visit nodes in the order `[3, 5, 1, 4, 7, 6, 8, 9, 2]`, and return to node `0`.\n- **Total Distance**: `15`.\n\nThis route provides a feasible solution to the TSP, balancing efficiency and simplicity given the graph's structure."
