For graphs with less than 18 nodes, optimal solutions are more suitable.\n   - Since we do not have the exact number of nodes, we will assume a general case. If we assume a small graph (less than 18 nodes), we would use the optimal solution. If we assume a larger graph (more than 18 nodes), we would use an approximate solution.\n\nGiven that the problem context does not specify the number of nodes, we will provide both options for clarity.\n\n### Output for Small Graph (less than 18 nodes):\n```json\n{\n    \"problem\": \"Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)\",\n    \"algorithm\": \"TSP Dynamic Programming (Held-Karp Algorithm)\",\n    \"parameters\": {\n        \"adjacency_list\": \"A complete weighted graph represented as an adjacency matrix or edge list.\"\n    },\n    \"complexity\": \"O(n^2 * 2^n), where n is the number of nodes.\",\n    \"description\": \"This algorithm is the best choice for small graphs as it provides an optimal solution using dynamic programming to efficiently compute the shortest route.\"\n}\n```\n\n### Output for Large Graph (more than 18 nodes):\n```json\n{\n    \"problem\": \"Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)\",\n    \"algorithm\": \"TSP Greedy Algorithm\",\n    \"parameters\": {\n        \"adjacency_list\": \"A weighted graph represented as an adjacency matrix or edge list.\"\n    },\n    \"complexity\": \"O(n^2), where n is the number of nodes.\",\n    \"description\": \"This algorithm is suitable for larger graphs as it provides a fast approximate solution, making it feasible to compute the route quickly, although it may not yield the optimal solution.\"\n}\n```\n\nIn summary, the choice of algorithm depends on the number of nodes in the graph.
