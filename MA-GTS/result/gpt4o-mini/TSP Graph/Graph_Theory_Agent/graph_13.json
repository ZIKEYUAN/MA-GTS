The TSP is known to be NP-hard, and the choice of algorithm depends on the number of nodes in the graph.\n\n2. **Graph Size**: The problem does not specify the number of nodes directly, but since it is a classic TSP problem, we can assume that the number of nodes could vary. However, based on the algorithm library, we know that:\n   - For graphs with **less than 18 nodes**, optimal solutions are preferred.\n   - For graphs with **more than 18 nodes**, approximate solutions are more suitable.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**: \n   - If the number of nodes is **less than 18**, the **TSP Dynamic Programming (Held-Karp Algorithm)** is the best choice because it provides an optimal solution.\n   - If the number of nodes is **18 or more**, the **TSP Greedy Algorithm** would be more appropriate as it provides a fast approximate solution.\n\nSince the number of nodes is not explicitly provided, we will assume a general case where we can select the optimal solution for smaller graphs.\n\nHere’s the output dictionary based on the analysis:\n\n```python\n{\n    \"problem\": \"Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)\",\n    \"algorithm\": \"TSP Dynamic Programming (Held-Karp Algorithm)\",\n    \"parameters\": {\n        \"adjacency_list\": \"A complete weighted graph represented as an adjacency matrix or edge list.\"\n    },\n    \"complexity\": \"O(n^2 * 2^n), where n is the number of nodes.
