  "response": "To analyze the provided information and select the appropriate algorithm for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), we need to consider the characteristics of the graph and the problem requirements.\n\n1. **Graph Characteristics**: The problem involves an undirected graph where the goal is to find the shortest route visiting each node exactly once and returning to the starting node. The TSP is a classic optimization problem.\n\n2. **Graph Size**: The problem does not specify the number of nodes in the graph. However, based on the algorithm library, we know:\n   - For graphs with **less than 18 nodes**, we should use an optimal solution algorithm.\n   - For graphs with **more than 18 nodes**, we should use an approximate solution algorithm.\n\n3. **Problem Type**: The problem is clearly defined as the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP).\n\nGiven this information, we will assume a scenario where the number of nodes is less than or equal to 18 for the optimal solution. If the number of nodes is greater than 18, we would switch to the approximate solution.\n\n### Output Dictionary\n\n```json\n{\n    \"problem\": \"Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)\",\n    \"algorithm\": \"TSP Dynamic Programming (Held-Karp Algorithm)\",\n    \"parameters\": {\n        \"adjacency_list\": \"A complete weighted graph represented as an adjacency matrix or edge list.\"\n    },\n    \"complexity\": \"O(n^2 * 2^n), where n is the number of nodes. This algorithm is efficient for small graphs due to its dynamic programming approach.\",\n    \"description\": \"The Held-Karp algorithm is the best choice for the TSP in this case because it provides an optimal solution for graphs with fewer than 18 nodes, leveraging dynamic programming to efficiently compute the shortest path that visits all nodes exactly once.\"\n}\n```\n\nIf the number of nodes were specified and found to be greater than 18, the algorithm would change to the TSP Greedy Algorithm, and the output would reflect that change."
