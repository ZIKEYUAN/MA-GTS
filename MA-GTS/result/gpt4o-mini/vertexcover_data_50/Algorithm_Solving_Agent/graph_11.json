The algorithm specified for solving this problem is the \"Vertex Cover Brute Force,\" which exhaustively checks all possible subsets of nodes to ensure that all communication links are monitored. Given that there are only 11 computers (nodes), this approach is feasible despite its exponential time complexity.\n\n### Algorithm Used\n- **Algorithm**: Vertex Cover Brute Force\n- **Input**: Adjacency list of the graph representing the connections between computers.\n\n### Tool Output\nThe output from the Vertex Cover Brute Force algorithm is:\n```json\n{\n  \"result\": {\n    \"cover_set\": [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8],\n    \"cover_size\": 7,\n    \"execution_time\": 0.0014569759368896484\n  }\n}\n```\nThis indicates that the optimal vertex cover consists of the nodes `[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8]`, which covers all edges in the graph.

The algorithm specified for this task is the **Vertex Cover Brute Force** method, which is optimal for small graphs with fewer than 20 nodes. Given that there are 11 computers in the network, this algorithm will effectively determine the minimum number of computers needed to monitor all communication links.\n\n### Algorithm Used\n- **Algorithm**: Vertex Cover Brute Force\n- **Input**: Adjacency list of the graph representing the connections between computers.\n\n### Tool's Output\nThe output from the Vertex Cover Brute Force algorithm is:\n- **Vertex Cover Set**: `[0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 8]`\n- **Size of Vertex Cover**: `6`\n- **Execution Time**: `0.0011448860168457031 seconds`\n\n### Analysis of the Output\nThe result indicates that the minimum vertex cover consists of the nodes `[0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 8]`, which corresponds to the following servers based on the node mapping:\n- **0**: Server Stealthwind\n- **1**: Server Tempest\n- **3**: Server Solarflare\n- **5**: Server Crimsoncloud\n- **7**: Server Falconeye\n- **8**: Server Ravenstone\n\nThus, the minimum number of computers needed to monitor all communication links in the network is **6**.\n\n### Final Answer\nTo monitor all communication links in the network of computers, the minimum number of computers required is **6**. The specific servers that should be included in the monitoring are:\n- Server Stealthwind\n- Server Tempest\n- Server Solarflare\n- Server Crimsoncloud\n- Server Falconeye\n- Server Ravenstone"
