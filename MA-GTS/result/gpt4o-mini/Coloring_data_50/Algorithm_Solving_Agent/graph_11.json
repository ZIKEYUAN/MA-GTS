  "response": "### Problem Summary\nThe problem at hand is to perform graph coloring on an undirected graph representing Wi-Fi base stations. The goal is to allocate frequencies (colors) to these base stations such that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency. The algorithm specified for this task is the Backtracking algorithm, which is suitable for small graphs like this one with 11 nodes.\n\n### Algorithm Used\n- **Algorithm**: Backtracking\n- **Graph Type**: Undirected\n- **Adjacency List**: Provided in the input.\n  \n### Tool's Output\nThe output from the graph coloring tool is as follows:\n```json\n{\n  \"result\": {\n    \"(3, [1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 3, 2], 0.00013208389282226562)\"\n  }\n}\n```\nThis output indicates:\n- The minimum number of colors used: **3**\n- The color allocation for each node (base station): \n  - Lighthouse Point (0): Color 1\n  - Northwind Tower (1): Color 1\n  - Sapphire Arena (2): Color 2\n  - Quartz District (3): Color 1\n  - Skyline Gardens (4): Color 1\n  - Umbra Theater (5): Color 2\n  - Rosewood Hall (6): Color 3\n  - Jasper Marina (7): Color 3\n  - Twilight Harbor (8): Color 2\n  - Riverstone Wharf (9): Color 3\n  - Evergreen Circle (10): Color 2\n- The time taken for the computation: approximately **0.000132 seconds**.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe optimal frequency allocation for the Wi-Fi base stations is achieved using **3 frequencies**. The color assignments for the base stations are as follows:\n- Lighthouse Point: Frequency 1\n- Northwind Tower: Frequency 1\n- Sapphire Arena: Frequency 2\n- Quartz District: Frequency 1\n- Skyline Gardens: Frequency 1\n- Umbra Theater: Frequency 2\n- Rosewood Hall: Frequency 3\n- Jasper Marina: Frequency 3\n- Twilight Harbor: Frequency 2\n- Riverstone Wharf: Frequency 3\n- Evergreen Circle: Frequency 2\n\nThis allocation ensures that no two adjacent base stations share the same frequency, thereby optimizing the frequency usage across the network."

The goal is to assign frequencies (colors) to these nodes such that no two adjacent nodes share the same frequency, thereby minimizing interference.\n\n### Algorithm Used\nThe **Backtracking** algorithm was selected for this problem due to its ability to systematically explore all possible frequency assignments and find the minimal coloring number optimally.\n\n### Tool Output\nThe output from the graph coloring algorithm is as follows:\n```json\n{\n  \"result\": {\n    \"coloring\": [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 1, 4, 2, 4, 1, 3],\n    \"number_of_colors\": 4,\n    \"execution_time\": 0.0033597946166992188\n  }\n}\n```\n- **Coloring Assignment**: The nodes are assigned the following frequencies:\n  - Node 0: Frequency 1\n  - Node 1: Frequency 2\n  - Node 2: Frequency 3\n  - Node 3: Frequency 1\n  - Node 4: Frequency 2\n  - Node 5: Frequency 1\n  - Node 6: Frequency 4\n  - Node 7: Frequency 2\n  - Node 8: Frequency 4\n  - Node 9: Frequency 1\n  - Node 10: Frequency 3\n- **Number of Colors Used**: 4\n- **Execution Time**: Approximately 0.0034 seconds\n\n### Final Answer\nThe optimal frequency allocation for the Wi-Fi base stations, ensuring that no two adjacent stations share the same frequency, uses a total of **4 frequencies**. The specific frequency assignments for each base station are as follows:\n\n- **Brass Lantern Tavern**: Frequency 1\n- **Amber Plaza**: Frequency 2\n- **Zenith Arena**: Frequency 3\n- **Rosewood Hall**: Frequency 1\n- **Westgate Station**: Frequency 2\n- **Union Square Market**: Frequency 1\n- **Oakshade Library**: Frequency 4\n- **Beacon Tower**: Frequency 2\n- **Gilded Archway**: Frequency 4\n- **Dragon’s Gate**: Frequency 1\n- **Cobalt Market**: Frequency 3\n\nThis allocation minimizes interference among the stations while adhering to the constraints of the problem."

The goal is to assign frequencies to the base stations such that no two adjacent stations share the same frequency. The graph is undirected and consists of 11 stations.\n\n### Algorithm Used\nThe algorithm employed is the **Greedy Coloring Algorithm**, which efficiently assigns colors (frequencies) to nodes in a graph while ensuring that adjacent nodes do not share the same color. The complexity of this algorithm is \\(O(n^2)\\), making it suitable for medium-sized graphs.\n\n### Tool's Output\nThe output from the graph coloring tool is as follows:\n- **Result**: `(4, [1, 2, 3, 1, 3, 4, 4, 2, 2, 1, 2], 0.0008037090301513672)`\n  - The first element `4` indicates the number of different frequencies used.\n  - The list `[1, 2, 3, 1, 3, 4, 4, 2, 2, 1, 2]` represents the frequency assigned to each of the 11 stations.\n  - The last element is the time taken to compute the result.\n\n### Analysis of the Output\nFrom the output, we can conclude that:\n- A total of **4 different frequencies** were used to color the graph.\n- The frequency assignments for the stations are as follows:\n  - Jade Fountain (0): Frequency 1\n  - Twilight Harbor (1): Frequency 2\n  - Ironbridge Crossing (2): Frequency 3\n  - Ivory Spire Cathedral (3): Frequency 1\n  - Lighthouse Point (4): Frequency 3\n  - Quarry Point (5): Frequency 4\n  - Azure Gardens (6): Frequency 4\n  - Yarrow Plaza (7): Frequency 2\n  - Amber Plaza (8): Frequency 2\n  - Dragon’s Gate (9): Frequency 1\n  - Beacon Tower (10): Frequency 2\n\n### Final Answer\nThe Greedy Coloring Algorithm successfully assigned frequencies to the Wi-Fi base stations, utilizing a total of **4 frequencies**. The frequency assignments ensure that no two adjacent stations share the same frequency, thus optimizing the allocation for the given graph structure."

  "response": "### Problem Summary\nThe problem at hand is to solve the **Graph Coloring** problem using the **Backtracking** algorithm. The goal is to color the nodes of an undirected graph representing Wi-Fi base stations in such a way that no two adjacent nodes (base stations) share the same color. This is crucial to avoid interference between overlapping coverage areas of the base stations.\n\n### Algorithm Used\nThe algorithm employed is **Backtracking**, which is suitable for this problem due to its ability to efficiently find the minimal coloring number for the graph. Given that there are 11 nodes (base stations), this approach is feasible.\n\n### Tool Output\nThe output from the graph coloring tool is:\n```json\n{\n  \"result\": {\n    \"(4, [1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 3, 1, 1, 4, 4, 3], 0.0005228519439697266)\"\n  }\n}\n```\nThis output indicates:\n- The minimum number of colors used is **4**.\n- The color assignment for each node is represented in the list: `[1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 3, 1, 1, 4, 4, 3]`.\n- The last value is the time taken to compute the solution, which is approximately **0.00052 seconds**.\n\n### Node Mapping\nUsing the node mapping provided, we can interpret the color assignments:\n- **Echo Station (0)**: Color 1\n- **Yarrow Plaza (1)**: Color 2\n- **Opal Theater (2)**: Color 1\n- **Umbra Theater (3)**: Color 2\n- **Northwind Tower (4)**: Color 3\n- **Flint Forge Quarter (5)**: Color 3\n- **Cobalt Market (6)**: Color 1\n- **Granite Plaza (7)**: Color 1\n- **Rosewood Hall (8)**: Color 4\n- **Ironbridge Crossing (9)**: Color 4\n- **Lunar Pier (10)**: Color 3\n\n### Final Answer\nThe minimum number of colors required to color the graph of Wi-Fi base stations is **4**. The color assignments ensure that no two adjacent stations interfere with each other, thus optimizing the frequency usage across the network."

The goal is to assign frequencies (colors) to the base stations such that no two adjacent stations share the same frequency. The graph is undirected and consists of 11 nodes (base stations).\n\n### Algorithm Used\nThe algorithm employed for this problem is **Backtracking**, which systematically explores all possible frequency assignments to ensure that adjacent nodes do not share the same frequency.\n\n### Tool Output\nThe output from the graph coloring algorithm is as follows:\n- **Result**: `(4, [1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 4, 3], 0.0006818771362304688)`\n  - **Number of Colors Used**: 4\n  - **Color Assignment**: \n    - Node 0: Color 1 (Nimbus Plaza)\n    - Node 1: Color 2 (Lunar Pier)\n    - Node 2: Color 1 (Gilded Archway)\n    - Node 3: Color 3 (Quartz District)\n    - Node 4: Color 1 (Moonlit Promenade)\n    - Node 5: Color 2 (Riverstone Wharf)\n    - Node 6: Color 3 (Temple Square)\n    - Node 7: Color 3 (Beacon Tower)\n    - Node 8: Color 2 (Evergreen Circle)\n    - Node 9: Color 4 (Umbra Theater)\n    - Node 10: Color 3 (Silvercrest Observatory)\n  - **Execution Time**: Approximately 0.00068 seconds\n\n### Final Answer\nThe graph coloring algorithm successfully assigned frequencies to the Wi-Fi base stations using a total of **4 different frequencies**. The specific color assignments for each base station are as follows:\n\n- **Nimbus Plaza**: Frequency 1\n- **Lunar Pier**: Frequency 2\n- **Gilded Archway**: Frequency 1\n- **Quartz District**: Frequency 3\n- **Moonlit Promenade**: Frequency 1\n- **Riverstone Wharf**: Frequency 2\n- **Temple Square**: Frequency 3\n- **Beacon Tower**: Frequency 3\n- **Evergreen Circle**: Frequency 2\n- **Umbra Theater**: Frequency 4\n- **Silvercrest Observatory**: Frequency 3\n\nThis assignment ensures that no two adjacent base stations are using the same frequency, thereby minimizing interference."

  "response": "### Problem Summary\nThe task is to solve the Graph Coloring problem using the Backtracking algorithm. The goal is to assign frequencies (colors) to Wi-Fi base stations (nodes) in such a way that no two adjacent stations (nodes connected by an edge in the graph) share the same frequency. The input graph is represented as an adjacency list, and the algorithm is expected to efficiently explore all possible frequency assignments to minimize interference.\n\n### Algorithm Used\n- **Algorithm**: Backtracking\n- **Input**: \n  - **Adjacency List**: \n    ```json\n    {\n      0: [(1, 1), (4, 1), (6, 1), (8, 1)],\n      1: [(0, 1), (4, 1), (6, 1), (8, 1), (10, 1)],\n      2: [(4, 1), (6, 1), (7, 1), (8, 1), (9, 1)],\n      3: [(6, 1), (9, 1), (10, 1)],\n      4: [(0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (5, 1), (9, 1)],\n      5: [(4, 1), (9, 1)],\n      6: [(0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (3, 1), (7, 1), (8, 1)],\n      7: [(2, 1), (6, 1), (8, 1)],\n      8: [(0, 1), (1, 1), (2, 1), (6, 1), (7, 1), (9, 1), (10, 1)],\n      9: [(2, 1), (4, 1), (5, 1), (3, 1), (8, 1)],\n      10: [(1, 1), (3, 1), (8, 1)]\n    }\n    ```\n\n### Tool Output\nThe output from the Backtracking algorithm is:\n```json\n{\n  \"result\": {\n    \"colors_used\": 4,\n    \"color_assignment\": [1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 3, 2, 4, 2, 3],\n    \"execution_time\": 0.0009911060333251953\n  }\n}\n```\n- **Colors Used**: 4\n- **Color Assignment**: \n  - Node 0: Color 1 (Nimbus Plaza)\n  - Node 1: Color 2 (Primrose Boulevard)\n  - Node 2: Color 1 (Moonlit Promenade)\n  - Node 3: Color 1 (Skyline Gardens)\n  - Node 4: Color 3 (Gilded Archway)\n  - Node 5: Color 1 (Westgate Station)\n  - Node 6: Color 3 (Zenith Arena)\n  - Node 7: Color 2 (Velvet Corner)\n  - Node 8: Color 4 (Mosaic Plaza)\n  - Node 9: Color 2 (Rosewood Hall)\n  - Node 10: Color 3 (Copper Clock Square)\n\n### Final Answer\nThe graph coloring problem has been solved using the Backtracking algorithm, resulting in the assignment of 4 different frequencies to the Wi-Fi base stations. The specific color assignments for each station are as follows:\n\n- **Nimbus Plaza**: Frequency 1\n- **Primrose Boulevard**: Frequency 2\n- **Moonlit Promenade**: Frequency 1\n- **Skyline Gardens**: Frequency 1\n- **Gilded Archway**: Frequency 3\n- **Westgate Station**: Frequency 1\n- **Zenith Arena**: Frequency 3\n- **Velvet Corner**: Frequency 2\n- **Mosaic Plaza**: Frequency 4\n- **Rosewood Hall**: Frequency 2\n- **Copper Clock Square**: Frequency 3\n\nThis assignment minimizes interference among the stations while using the least number of frequencies possible."

  "response": "### Problem Summary\nThe problem at hand is to color a graph representing Wi-Fi base stations using the Greedy Coloring Algorithm. The goal is to assign frequencies (colors) to the base stations such that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, thereby minimizing interference.\n\n### Algorithm Used\nThe algorithm employed for this problem is the **Greedy Coloring Algorithm**. This algorithm is efficient for the given graph of 11 stations and operates with a complexity of \\(O(n^2)\\).\n\n### Tool Output\nThe output from the graph coloring tool is as follows:\n- **Result**: `(4, [1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 3, 4, 1, 3, 4], 0.0014348030090332031)`\n  - The first element `4` indicates the number of colors used.\n  - The list `[1, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 3, 4, 1, 3, 4]` represents the color assigned to each of the 11 stations.\n  - The last element is the time taken to compute the solution.\n\n### Node Mapping\nUsing the provided node mapping, we can interpret the colors assigned to each station:\n- **Flint Forge Quarter (0)**: Color 1\n- **Granite Plaza (1)**: Color 1\n- **Ironbridge Crossing (2)**: Color 2\n- **Umbra Theater (3)**: Color 3\n- **Pennywhistle Arcade (4)**: Color 2\n- **Quartz District (5)**: Color 1\n- **Echo Station (6)**: Color 3\n- **Evergreen Circle (7)**: Color 4\n- **Copper Clock Square (8)**: Color 1\n- **Jade Fountain (9)**: Color 3\n- **Westgate Station (10)**: Color 4\n\n### Final Answer\nThe Greedy Coloring Algorithm successfully assigned frequencies to the 11 Wi-Fi base stations using **4 different frequencies**. The assigned frequencies are as follows:\n- Flint Forge Quarter: Frequency 1\n- Granite Plaza: Frequency 1\n- Ironbridge Crossing: Frequency 2\n- Umbra Theater: Frequency 3\n- Pennywhistle Arcade: Frequency 2\n- Quartz District: Frequency 1\n- Echo Station: Frequency 3\n- Evergreen Circle: Frequency 4\n- Copper Clock Square: Frequency 1\n- Jade Fountain: Frequency 3\n- Westgate Station: Frequency 4\n\nThis allocation ensures that no two adjacent stations share the same frequency, effectively minimizing interference."

The graph consists of **11 nodes**, representing different locations, and the goal is to minimize interference by ensuring that adjacent nodes have different frequencies.\n\n### Algorithm Used\nThe algorithm selected for this problem is **Backtracking**, which is well-suited for small graphs like this one (with fewer than 20 nodes). The backtracking algorithm systematically explores all possible colorings to find the optimal solution for minimizing the number of frequencies needed.\n\n### Tool's Output\nThe output from the graph coloring algorithm is as follows:\n- **Result**: `(4, [1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 3], 0.0005540847778320312)`\n  - **4**: This indicates that a total of **4 frequencies** are needed.\n  - **[1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 3]**: This is the frequency assignment for each of the 11 nodes.\n  - **0.0005540847778320312**: This is the time taken to compute the solution (in seconds).\n\n### Analysis of the Output\nFrom the output, we can conclude that:\n- A total of **4 different frequencies** are required to color the graph without any two adjacent nodes sharing the same frequency.\n- The frequency assignments for the nodes are as follows:\n  - **Beacon Tower (0)**: Frequency 1\n  - **Knight’s Market (1)**: Frequency 2\n  - **Riverstone Wharf (2)**: Frequency 2\n  - **Quartz District (3)**: Frequency 1\n  - **Rosewood Hall (4)**: Frequency 1\n  - **Westgate Station (5)**: Frequency 3\n  - **Union Square Market (6)**: Frequency 3\n  - **Opal Theater (7)**: Frequency 4\n  - **Gilded Archway (8)**: Frequency 4\n  - **Skyline Gardens (9)**: Frequency 4\n  - **Oakshade Library (10)**: Frequency 3\n\n### Final Answer\nTo minimize interference among the Wi-Fi base stations, we need to use a total of **4 different frequencies**.

  "response": "### Problem Summary\nThe problem at hand is to color a graph representing Wi-Fi base stations using the Backtracking algorithm. The goal is to assign frequencies to the base stations such that no two adjacent stations share the same frequency, thereby minimizing interference. The graph consists of 11 nodes (base stations) with specified connections (edges) between them.\n\n### Algorithm Used\nThe algorithm employed for this problem is **Backtracking**, which is suitable for exploring all possible frequency allocations in the graph.\n\n### Tool Output\nThe output from the Backtracking algorithm is as follows:\n- **Result**: `(4, [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 3, 4, 4, 1, 1, 3], 0.00017881393432617188)`\n  - **4**: This indicates the minimum number of colors (frequencies) used.\n  - **[1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 3, 4, 4, 1, 1, 3]**: This array represents the color assigned to each base station (node) in the order of their IDs.\n  - **0.00017881393432617188**: This is the time taken to compute the solution.\n\n### Analysis of the Output\nFrom the output, we can deduce the following:\n- A total of **4 different frequencies** were used to color the graph.\n- The frequency assignments for each base station (based on the node mapping) are as follows:\n  - Ironbridge Crossing (0): Frequency 1\n  - Azure Gardens (1): Frequency 2\n  - Ivory Spire Cathedral (2): Frequency 2\n  - Twilight Harbor (3): Frequency 3\n  - Lighthouse Point (4): Frequency 4\n  - Rosewood Hall (5): Frequency 3\n  - Velvet Corner (6): Frequency 4\n  - Amber Plaza (7): Frequency 4\n  - Skyline Gardens (8): Frequency 1\n  - Haven Docks (9): Frequency 1\n  - Knight’s Market (10): Frequency 3\n\n### Final Answer\nThe optimal frequency allocation for the Wi-Fi base stations, ensuring that no two adjacent stations share the same frequency, uses a total of **4 frequencies**. The specific frequency assignments are as follows:\n- Ironbridge Crossing: 1\n- Azure Gardens: 2\n- Ivory Spire Cathedral: 2\n- Twilight Harbor: 3\n- Lighthouse Point: 4\n- Rosewood Hall: 3\n- Velvet Corner: 4\n- Amber Plaza: 4\n- Skyline Gardens: 1\n- Haven Docks: 1\n- Knight’s Market: 3\n\nThis allocation minimizes potential interference among the base stations."

  "response": "### Summary of the Problem and Algorithm Used\nThe problem at hand is to color a graph representing Wi-Fi base stations using the Backtracking algorithm. The goal is to minimize the number of frequencies (colors) needed while ensuring that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency. The graph consists of 11 nodes (base stations), and the adjacency list describes the connections between them.\n\n### Tool's Output\nThe output from the graph coloring algorithm is:\n```\n{\n  'result': {\n    '(4, [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4], 0.0023589134216308594)'\n  }\n}\n```\nThis output indicates that the optimal solution uses 4 colors (frequencies) to color the graph. The specific color assignment for each node is as follows:\n- Node 0 (Granite Plaza): Color 1\n- Node 1 (Mosaic Plaza): Color 1\n- Node 2 (Beacon Tower): Color 1\n- Node 3 (Union Square Market): Color 2\n- Node 4 (Azure Gardens): Color 2\n- Node 5 (Jade Fountain): Color 1\n- Node 6 (Shadowbridge Arcade): Color 2\n- Node 7 (Evergreen Circle): Color 3\n- Node 8 (Horizon Mall): Color 4\n- Node 9 (Pennywhistle Arcade): Color 4\n- Node 10 (Brass Lantern Tavern): Color 4\n\n### Final Answer\nThe minimum number of frequencies needed to color the Wi-Fi base stations, ensuring that no two adjacent stations share the same frequency, is **4**. The color assignments are distributed among the base stations as detailed above."

  "response": "### Problem Summary\nThe problem involves graph coloring, specifically assigning frequencies to Wi-Fi base stations represented as nodes in an undirected graph. The goal is to ensure that no two adjacent nodes (base stations) share the same frequency, thereby optimizing the frequency allocation. The algorithm used for this task is the Backtracking algorithm, which is suitable for exploring all possible combinations to minimize the number of frequencies needed.\n\n### Algorithm Used\n- **Algorithm**: Backtracking\n- **Complexity**: O(2^n), where n is the number of nodes (base stations).\n\n### Tool Output\nThe output from the graph coloring tool is:\n```json\n{\n  \"result\": {\n    \"number_of_frequencies\": 4,\n    \"frequency_assignment\": [1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 1, 4, 4, 3],\n    \"execution_time\": 0.0004837512969970703\n  }\n}\n```\n- **Number of Frequencies Used**: 4\n- **Frequency Assignment**: \n  - Flare Alley: 1\n  - Pennywhistle Arcade: 2\n  - Brass Lantern Tavern: 1\n  - Opal Theater: 2\n  - Ivory Spire Cathedral: 3\n  - Silvercrest Observatory: 1\n  - Sapphire Arena: 1\n  - Yarrow Plaza: 1\n  - Nimbus Plaza: 4\n  - Lighthouse Point: 4\n  - Temple Square: 3\n\n### Final Answer Analysis\nBased on the output, we can summarize the frequency assignments for each base station as follows:\n\n- **Flare Alley**: Frequency 1\n- **Pennywhistle Arcade**: Frequency 2\n- **Brass Lantern Tavern**: Frequency 1\n- **Opal Theater**: Frequency 2\n- **Ivory Spire Cathedral**: Frequency 3\n- **Silvercrest Observatory**: Frequency 1\n- **Sapphire Arena**: Frequency 1\n- **Yarrow Plaza**: Frequency 1\n- **Nimbus Plaza**: Frequency 4\n- **Lighthouse Point**: Frequency 4\n- **Temple Square**: Frequency 3\n\nThus, the final answer is that a total of **4 frequencies** are required to color the graph, ensuring that no two adjacent base stations share the same frequency."

The goal is to assign frequencies (colors) to the base stations such that no two adjacent stations share the same frequency. The graph is undirected and consists of 11 nodes (base stations).\n\n### Algorithm Used\nThe algorithm employed for this problem is **Backtracking**, which is suitable for exploring all possible frequency assignments while ensuring that adjacent nodes do not share the same frequency.\n\n### Tool's Output\nThe output from the graph coloring algorithm is:\n```\n{\n  'result': {\n    '(4, [1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 4, 4, 4, 1, 1], 0.0004837512969970703)'\n  }\n}\n```\nThis output indicates that the graph can be colored using **4 colors**. The array `[1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 3, 4, 4, 4, 1, 1]` represents the color assigned to each of the 11 nodes, and the last value `0.0004837512969970703` is the time taken to compute the solution.\n\n### Analysis of the Output\n1. **Number of Colors Used**: The algorithm determined that a maximum of 4 colors is necessary to color the graph without any two adjacent nodes sharing the same color.\n2. **Color Assignment**: The color assignment for each base station is as follows:\n   - Velvet Corner (0): Color 1\n   - Rosewood Hall (1): Color 2\n   - Moonlit Promenade (2): Color 2\n   - Shadowbridge Arcade (3): Color 2\n   - Nimbus Plaza (4): Color 1\n   - Sapphire Arena (5): Color 3\n   - Ivory Spire Cathedral (6): Color 4\n   - Flare Alley (7): Color 4\n   - Union Square Market (8): Color 4\n   - Evergreen Circle (9): Color 1\n   - Flint Forge Quarter (10): Color 1\n\n### Final Answer\nThe graph representing the Wi-Fi base stations can be colored using **4 different frequencies**.

  "response": "### Problem Summary\nThe problem at hand is to solve the **Graph Coloring** problem using the **Backtracking** algorithm. The goal is to assign frequencies to Wi-Fi base stations represented as nodes in an undirected graph such that no two adjacent nodes (base stations) share the same frequency. The provided adjacency list represents the connections between these base stations based on their overlapping coverage areas.\n\n### Algorithm Used\nThe algorithm employed is **Backtracking**, which systematically explores all possible frequency assignments to ensure that adjacent base stations do not share the same frequency.\n\n### Tool's Output\nThe output from the graph coloring algorithm is:\n```\n{\n  'result': {\n    '(3, [1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3], 0.00025534629821777344)'\n  }\n}\n```\nThis output indicates that:\n- A total of **3 colors** (frequencies) were used.\n- The frequency assignment for each base station is represented in the list: `[1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3]`.\n- The last value represents the time taken to compute the solution, which is approximately **0.000255 seconds**.\n\n### Analysis of the Output\nFrom the output, we can interpret the frequency assignments as follows:\n- **Shadowbridge Arcade (0)**: Frequency 1\n- **Duskwood Park (1)**: Frequency 1\n- **Temple Square (2)**: Frequency 2\n- **Willowshade Pavilion (3)**: Frequency 1\n- **Westgate Station (4)**: Frequency 1\n- **Jasper Marina (5)**: Frequency 3\n- **Sapphire Arena (6)**: Frequency 1\n- **Copper Clock Square (7)**: Frequency 2\n- **Cobalt Market (8)**: Frequency 3\n- **Amber Plaza (9)**: Frequency 3\n- **Umbra Theater (10)**: Frequency 3\n\n### Final Answer\nThe final answer to the graph coloring problem is that it is possible to color the graph using **3 different frequencies**. The frequency assignments for the Wi-Fi base stations are as follows:\n\n- Shadowbridge Arcade: Frequency 1\n- Duskwood Park: Frequency 1\n- Temple Square: Frequency 2\n- Willowshade Pavilion: Frequency 1\n- Westgate Station: Frequency 1\n- Jasper Marina: Frequency 3\n- Sapphire Arena: Frequency 1\n- Copper Clock Square: Frequency 2\n- Cobalt Market: Frequency 3\n- Amber Plaza: Frequency 3\n- Umbra Theater: Frequency 3\n\nThis ensures that no two adjacent base stations share the same frequency."
