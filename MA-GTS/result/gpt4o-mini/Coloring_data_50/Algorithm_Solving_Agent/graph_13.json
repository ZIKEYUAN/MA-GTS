  "response": "### Problem Summary\nThe task involves solving a graph coloring problem using the Coloring Backtracking Algorithm. The goal is to assign frequencies (colors) to Wi-Fi base stations (nodes) in such a way that no two adjacent stations (those with overlapping coverage) share the same frequency.\n\n### Algorithm Used\nThe algorithm employed is the **Coloring Backtracking Algorithm**, which is suitable for this problem due to its ability to provide an optimal solution for coloring the graph while handling the small graph size effectively.\n\n### Tool's Output\nThe output from the algorithm is as follows:\n- **Number of Colors Used**: 4\n- **Color Assignment**: \n  - Union Square Market (Node 0): Color 1\n  - Skyline Gardens (Node 1): Color 1\n  - Rosewood Hall (Node 2): Color 2\n  - Zenith Arena (Node 3): Color 2\n  - Quartz District (Node 4): Color 3\n  - Umbra Theater (Node 5): Color 4\n  - Beacon Tower (Node 6): Color 1\n  - Mosaic Plaza (Node 7): Color 1\n  - Granite Plaza (Node 8): Color 3\n  - Willowshade Pavilion (Node 9): Color 4\n  - Flare Alley (Node 10): Color 3\n  - Quarry Point (Node 11): Color 1\n  - Knight’s Market (Node 12): Color 2\n\n### Analysis of the Output\nThe algorithm successfully assigned frequencies to the 13 base stations while ensuring that no two adjacent stations share the same frequency. The maximum number of colors used is 4, which indicates that the graph can be colored optimally with this number of frequencies.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe optimal frequency assignment for the Wi-Fi base stations is as follows:\n- **Union Square Market**: Frequency 1\n- **Skyline Gardens**: Frequency 1\n- **Rosewood Hall**: Frequency 2\n- **Zenith Arena**: Frequency 2\n- **Quartz District**: Frequency 3\n- **Umbra Theater**: Frequency 4\n- **Beacon Tower**: Frequency 1\n- **Mosaic Plaza**: Frequency 1\n- **Granite Plaza**: Frequency 3\n- **Willowshade Pavilion**: Frequency 4\n- **Flare Alley**: Frequency 3\n- **Quarry Point**: Frequency 1\n- **Knight’s Market**: Frequency 2\n\nThis assignment ensures that all adjacent stations operate on different frequencies, thus optimizing the coverage without interference."

  "response": "### Problem Summary\nThe task is to solve a graph coloring problem using the Greedy Coloring Algorithm. The goal is to assign frequencies to 13 Wi-Fi base stations represented as nodes in an undirected graph, minimizing interference between adjacent stations.\n\n### Algorithm Used\nThe algorithm specified for this problem is the **Greedy Coloring Algorithm**. This algorithm efficiently assigns colors (or frequencies) to nodes in a graph while ensuring that no two adjacent nodes share the same color.\n\n### Tool's Output\nThe output from the graph coloring algorithm is as follows:\n- **Number of colors used**: 4\n- **Color assignment**: \n  - Azure Gardens (0): Color 1\n  - Amber Plaza (1): Color 2\n  - Northwind Tower (2): Color 3\n  - Lighthouse Point (3): Color 1\n  - Umbra Theater (4): Color 2\n  - Twilight Harbor (5): Color 4\n  - Oakshade Library (6): Color 2\n  - Temple Square (7): Color 1\n  - Jade Fountain (8): Color 1\n  - Velvet Corner (9): Color 4\n  - Ironbridge Crossing (10): Color 3\n  - Cobalt Market (11): Color 3\n  - Yarrow Plaza (12): Color 1\n\n### Analysis of the Output\nThe algorithm successfully assigned colors to the Wi-Fi base stations while ensuring that no two adjacent stations share the same frequency. The total number of different frequencies used is 4, which is efficient given the constraints of the problem.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe graph coloring for the Wi-Fi base stations resulted in the use of **4 different frequencies**. The frequencies were assigned as follows:\n\n- **Color 1**: Azure Gardens, Lighthouse Point, Temple Square, Jade Fountain, Yarrow Plaza\n- **Color 2**: Amber Plaza, Umbra Theater, Oakshade Library\n- **Color 3**: Northwind Tower, Ironbridge Crossing, Cobalt Market\n- **Color 4**: Twilight Harbor, Velvet Corner\n\nThis allocation minimizes interference effectively among the stations."

The goal is to assign frequencies (colors) to each base station such that no two adjacent stations share the same frequency, thereby avoiding interference.\n\n### Algorithm Used\nThe algorithm employed for this task is the **Greedy Coloring Algorithm**. This algorithm is efficient for approximating the minimum number of colors needed for graph coloring, particularly in scenarios where the graph is undirected and the connections (edges) between nodes (base stations) are defined.\n\n### Tool Output\nThe output from the graph coloring tool is as follows:\n- **Number of Colors Used**: 4\n- **Color Assignment**: \n  - Yarrow Plaza (0): Color 1\n  - Ivory Spire Cathedral (1): Color 1\n  - Duskwood Park (2): Color 2\n  - Moonlit Promenade (3): Color 1\n  - Maplewood Conservatory (4): Color 3\n  - Amber Plaza (5): Color 3\n  - Brass Lantern Tavern (6): Color 1\n  - Sapphire Arena (7): Color 4\n  - Lighthouse Point (8): Color 3\n  - Union Square Market (9): Color 3\n  - Silvercrest Observatory (10): Color 1\n  - Cobalt Market (11): Color 1\n  - Rosewood Hall (12): Color 2\n\n### Analysis of the Output\nThe algorithm successfully assigned 4 different frequencies (colors) to the 13 Wi-Fi base stations.

  "response": "### Problem Summary\nThe problem at hand is to color a graph representing the connections between 13 Wi-Fi base stations using the Greedy Coloring Algorithm. The goal is to assign frequencies to the base stations such that no two adjacent stations share the same frequency. The provided adjacency list represents the undirected graph, and the algorithm is expected to efficiently minimize the number of frequencies used.\n\n### Algorithm Used\nThe algorithm employed is the **Greedy Coloring Algorithm**, which is suitable for this type of problem due to its efficiency in assigning colors (or frequencies) to nodes in a graph.\n\n### Tool Output\nThe output from the graph coloring tool is as follows:\n- **Number of Colors Used**: 4\n- **Color Assignment**: \n  - Dragon’s Gate (0): Color 1\n  - Primrose Boulevard (1): Color 2\n  - Oakshade Library (2): Color 1\n  - Cobalt Market (3): Color 2\n  - Echo Station (4): Color 1\n  - Opal Theater (5): Color 3\n  - Haven Docks (6): Color 2\n  - Moonlit Promenade (7): Color 3\n  - Duskwood Park (8): Color 1\n  - Mosaic Plaza (9): Color 4\n  - Gilded Archway (10): Color 3\n  - Skyline Gardens (11): Color 2\n  - Riverstone Wharf (12): Color 4\n\n### Analysis of the Output\nThe algorithm successfully assigned frequencies (colors) to the 13 Wi-Fi base stations while ensuring that no two adjacent stations share the same frequency.

  "response": "### Problem Summary\nThe task is to solve the Graph Coloring problem using the Greedy Coloring Algorithm. The goal is to assign frequencies (or colors) to 13 Wi-Fi base stations represented as nodes in an undirected graph, ensuring that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency. The provided adjacency list represents the connections between these stations.\n\n### Algorithm Used\nThe algorithm employed for this task is the **Greedy Coloring Algorithm**. This algorithm is efficient for assigning colors to nodes in a graph while minimizing interference, which is crucial for the frequency allocation of Wi-Fi base stations.\n\n### Tool Output\nThe output from the graph coloring algorithm is as follows:\n- **Number of Colors Used**: 4\n- **Color Assignment**: \n  - Zenith Arena (Node 0): Color 1\n  - Amber Plaza (Node 1): Color 2\n  - Twilight Harbor (Node 2): Color 2\n  - Umbra Theater (Node 3): Color 3\n  - Silvercrest Observatory (Node 4): Color 3\n  - Velvet Corner (Node 5): Color 1\n  - Azure Gardens (Node 6): Color 1\n  - King’s Row (Node 7): Color 2\n  - Westgate Station (Node 8): Color 4\n  - Cobalt Market (Node 9): Color 4\n  - Quarry Point (Node 10): Color 2\n  - Granite Plaza (Node 11): Color 1\n  - Riverstone Wharf (Node 12): Color 4\n\n### Final Answer\nThe Greedy Coloring Algorithm successfully assigned frequencies to the 13 Wi-Fi base stations using a total of **4 different frequencies**. The color assignments ensure that no two adjacent stations interfere with each other, which is essential for optimal performance in a Wi-Fi network. \n\nHere is the summary of the frequency allocation:\n- **Zenith Arena**: Frequency 1\n- **Amber Plaza**: Frequency 2\n- **Twilight Harbor**: Frequency 2\n- **Umbra Theater**: Frequency 3\n- **Silvercrest Observatory**: Frequency 3\n- **Velvet Corner**: Frequency 1\n- **Azure Gardens**: Frequency 1\n- **King’s Row**: Frequency 2\n- **Westgate Station**: Frequency 4\n- **Cobalt Market**: Frequency 4\n- **Quarry Point**: Frequency 2\n- **Granite Plaza**: Frequency 1\n- **Riverstone Wharf**: Frequency 4\n\nThis allocation minimizes interference among the stations effectively."

This is crucial for minimizing interference among the stations.\n\n### Algorithm Used\nThe algorithm employed is the **Coloring Backtracking Algorithm**, which is suitable for small graphs like this one (with fewer than 25 nodes) due to its exponential time complexity of \\(O(2^n)\\).\n\n### Tool Output\nThe output from the graph coloring tool is as follows:\n- **Number of Colors Used**: 4\n- **Color Assignment**: \n  - Haven Docks (0): Color 1\n  - Mosaic Plaza (1): Color 1\n  - Rosewood Hall (2): Color 2\n  - Gilded Archway (3): Color 2\n  - Pennywhistle Arcade (4): Color 3\n  - Sapphire Arena (5): Color 2\n  - Flare Alley (6): Color 3\n  - Jasper Marina (7): Color 4\n  - Ironbridge Crossing (8): Color 1\n  - Flint Forge Quarter (9): Color 1\n  - Lunar Pier (10): Color 3\n  - Cobalt Market (11): Color 2\n  - Dragon’s Gate (12): Color 4\n- **Execution Time**: 0.0 seconds\n\n### Analysis of the Output\nThe algorithm successfully assigned 4 different frequencies to the 13 base stations while ensuring that no two adjacent stations share the same frequency. The color assignments are as follows:\n\n- **Color 1**: Haven Docks, Mosaic Plaza, Ironbridge Crossing, Flint Forge Quarter\n- **Color 2**: Rosewood Hall, Gilded Archway, Sapphire Arena, Lunar Pier, Cobalt Market\n- **Color 3**: Pennywhistle Arcade, Flare Alley\n- **Color 4**: Jasper Marina, Dragon’s Gate\n\nThis allocation minimizes interference effectively, as required.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe optimal frequency allocation for the 13 Wi-Fi base stations is achieved using 4 different frequencies, with the specific assignments detailed above. This ensures that no two adjacent stations interfere with each other."

  "response": "### Problem Summary\nThe task is to solve a graph coloring problem for 13 Wi-Fi base stations represented as nodes in an undirected graph. The goal is to assign frequencies (colors) to these nodes such that no two adjacent nodes (stations with overlapping coverage) share the same frequency. The **Coloring Backtracking Algorithm** was selected for this problem due to its effectiveness in finding the minimal coloring number through systematic exploration.\n\n### Algorithm Used\n- **Algorithm**: Coloring Backtracking Algorithm\n- **Complexity**: O(2^n)\n\n### Tool's Output\nThe output from the graph coloring algorithm is as follows:\n- **Minimum number of colors (frequencies) needed**: 4\n- **Color assignment for each node**: \n  - Gilded Archway (0): Color 1\n  - Amber Plaza (1): Color 2\n  - Horizon Mall (2): Color 1\n  - Flint Forge Quarter (3): Color 2\n  - Lunar Pier (4): Color 1\n  - Shadowbridge Arcade (5): Color 2\n  - Nimbus Plaza (6): Color 3\n  - Echo Station (7): Color 1\n  - Knight’s Market (8): Color 4\n  - Lighthouse Point (9): Color 2\n  - Silvercrest Observatory (10): Color 4\n  - Granite Plaza (11): Color 2\n  - Jade Fountain (12): Color 3\n\n### Analysis of the Output\nThe algorithm determined that a total of **4 frequencies** are required to ensure that no two adjacent Wi-Fi base stations interfere with each other. The color assignment indicates which frequency each station should use, ensuring compliance with the adjacency constraints.\n\n### Final Answer\nTo allocate frequencies to the 13 Wi-Fi base stations while avoiding interference, a total of **4 distinct frequencies** are needed. The specific frequency assignments for each station are as follows:\n- Gilded Archway: Frequency 1\n- Amber Plaza: Frequency 2\n- Horizon Mall: Frequency 1\n- Flint Forge Quarter: Frequency 2\n- Lunar Pier: Frequency 1\n- Shadowbridge Arcade: Frequency 2\n- Nimbus Plaza: Frequency 3\n- Echo Station: Frequency 1\n- Knight’s Market: Frequency 4\n- Lighthouse Point: Frequency 2\n- Silvercrest Observatory: Frequency 4\n- Granite Plaza: Frequency 2\n- Jade Fountain: Frequency 3\n\nThis allocation ensures that adjacent stations do not share the same frequency, thus optimizing the performance of the Wi-Fi network."

The goal is to assign frequencies to Wi-Fi base stations represented as nodes in an undirected graph, minimizing interference between overlapping coverage areas.\n\n### Algorithm Used\nThe algorithm employed is the **Greedy Coloring Algorithm**, which is efficient for this type of problem, especially given the graph's size (13 nodes). The complexity of the algorithm is \\(O(n^2)\\).\n\n### Tool's Output\nThe output from the graph coloring tool is as follows:\n- **Number of Colors Used**: 4\n- **Color Assignment**: \n  - Node 0 (Brass Lantern Tavern): Color 1\n  - Node 1 (Beacon Tower): Color 1\n  - Node 2 (Shadowbridge Arcade): Color 1\n  - Node 3 (Jade Fountain): Color 2\n  - Node 4 (Willowshade Pavilion): Color 2\n  - Node 5 (Nimbus Plaza): Color 2\n  - Node 6 (Velvet Corner): Color 3\n  - Node 7 (Primrose Boulevard): Color 1\n  - Node 8 (Umbra Theater): Color 3\n  - Node 9 (Westgate Station): Color 4\n  - Node 10 (Jasper Marina): Color 3\n  - Node 11 (Temple Square): Color 2\n  - Node 12 (King’s Row): Color 3\n- **Execution Time**: Approximately 0.001 seconds\n\n### Final Answer\nThe Greedy Coloring Algorithm successfully assigned frequencies to the Wi-Fi base stations with a total of **4 different frequencies** used. The color assignments ensure that no two adjacent nodes (base stations) share the same frequency, thereby minimizing interference.\n\nHere is the frequency assignment for each base station:\n- **Brass Lantern Tavern**: Frequency 1\n- **Beacon Tower**: Frequency 1\n- **Shadowbridge Arcade**: Frequency 1\n- **Jade Fountain**: Frequency 2\n- **Willowshade Pavilion**: Frequency 2\n- **Nimbus Plaza**: Frequency 2\n- **Velvet Corner**: Frequency 3\n- **Primrose Boulevard**: Frequency 1\n- **Umbra Theater**: Frequency 3\n- **Westgate Station**: Frequency 4\n- **Jasper Marina**: Frequency 3\n- **Temple Square**: Frequency 2\n- **King’s Row**: Frequency 3\n\nThis allocation effectively manages the frequencies for the Wi-Fi base stations while adhering to the constraints of the problem."

  "response": "### Problem Summary\nThe problem at hand is to color a graph representing the overlapping coverage areas of Wi-Fi base stations using the Greedy Coloring Algorithm. The goal is to assign frequencies (colors) to the base stations (nodes) such that no two adjacent stations share the same frequency. The graph is undirected and consists of 13 base stations.\n\n### Algorithm Used\nThe algorithm employed is the **Greedy Coloring Algorithm**, which efficiently assigns colors to the nodes of the graph while ensuring that adjacent nodes do not share the same color. The complexity of this algorithm is \\(O(n^2)\\), making it suitable for the given problem constraints.\n\n### Tool's Output\nThe output from the graph coloring tool is as follows:\n- **Number of colors used**: 4\n- **Color assignment for each node**: \n  - Willowshade Pavilion (0): Color 1\n  - Maplewood Conservatory (1): Color 1\n  - Sapphire Arena (2): Color 2\n  - Flare Alley (3): Color 1\n  - Westgate Station (4): Color 3\n  - Shadowbridge Arcade (5): Color 2\n  - Northwind Tower (6): Color 4\n  - Dragon’s Gate (7): Color 3\n  - Rosewood Hall (8): Color 3\n  - Silvercrest Observatory (9): Color 4\n  - Echo Station (10): Color 3\n  - Quarry Point (11): Color 1\n  - Evergreen Circle (12): Color 0 (no connections)\n\n### Final Answer\nThe Greedy Coloring Algorithm successfully assigned frequencies to the 13 base stations, using a total of **4 different frequencies**. The color assignments ensure that no two adjacent base stations share the same frequency, which is crucial for minimizing interference in the Wi-Fi coverage areas. \n\nThe final color assignments are as follows:\n- Willowshade Pavilion: Frequency 1\n- Maplewood Conservatory: Frequency 1\n- Sapphire Arena: Frequency 2\n- Flare Alley: Frequency 1\n- Westgate Station: Frequency 3\n- Shadowbridge Arcade: Frequency 2\n- Northwind Tower: Frequency 4\n- Dragon’s Gate: Frequency 3\n- Rosewood Hall: Frequency 3\n- Silvercrest Observatory: Frequency 4\n- Echo Station: Frequency 3\n- Quarry Point: Frequency 1\n- Evergreen Circle: No frequency needed (0)\n\nThis solution effectively minimizes the number of frequencies used while ensuring compliance with the adjacency constraints."

A total of **5 different frequencies** (colors) were used. \n\nThe color assignments for the stations are as follows:\n- Ironbridge Crossing: Frequency 1\n- Horizon Mall: Frequency 1\n- Dragon’s Gate: Frequency 2\n- Northwind Tower: Frequency 3\n- Zenith Arena: Frequency 4\n- Granite Plaza: Frequency 2\n- Amber Plaza: Frequency 3\n- Westgate Station: Frequency 1\n- Primrose Boulevard: Frequency 4\n- Oakshade Library: Frequency 3\n- Riverstone Wharf: Frequency 2\n- Echo Station: Frequency 2\n- Umbra Theater: Frequency 5\n\nThis allocation minimizes interference among adjacent stations while effectively utilizing the available frequencies."

  "response": "### Summary of the Problem and Algorithm Used\nThe problem at hand is a **Graph Coloring** problem, where we need to assign frequencies (colors) to Wi-Fi base stations (nodes) in such a way that no two adjacent base stations share the same frequency. This is crucial to minimize interference among the stations. \n\nThe selected algorithm for solving this problem is the **Coloring Backtracking Algorithm**, which is optimal for the given graph size (13 nodes). This algorithm systematically explores all possible color assignments to find the minimal number of frequencies needed.\n\n### Tool's Output\nThe output from the Coloring Backtracking Algorithm is as follows:\n- **Minimum Number of Colors (Frequencies)**: 4\n- **Color Assignment**: \n  - Node 0 (Umbra Theater): Color 1\n  - Node 1 (Maplewood Conservatory): Color 1\n  - Node 2 (Gilded Archway): Color 2\n  - Node 3 (Jade Fountain): Color 3\n  - Node 4 (Shadowbridge Arcade): Color 2\n  - Node 5 (Duskwood Park): Color 3\n  - Node 6 (Willowshade Pavilion): Color 4\n  - Node 7 (Granite Plaza): Color 1\n  - Node 8 (Moonlit Promenade): Color 4\n  - Node 9 (Evergreen Circle): Color 1\n  - Node 10 (Ironbridge Crossing): Color 3\n  - Node 11 (Westgate Station): Color 1\n  - Node 12 (King’s Row): Color 2\n- **Execution Time**: Approximately 0.0037 seconds\n\n### Final Answer\nBased on the output of the Coloring Backtracking Algorithm, we conclude that a minimum of **4 frequencies** is required to ensure that no two adjacent Wi-Fi base stations interfere with each other. The specific frequency assignments for each base station are as follows:\n\n- **Umbra Theater**: Frequency 1\n- **Maplewood Conservatory**: Frequency 1\n- **Gilded Archway**: Frequency 2\n- **Jade Fountain**: Frequency 3\n- **Shadowbridge Arcade**: Frequency 2\n- **Duskwood Park**: Frequency 3\n- **Willowshade Pavilion**: Frequency 4\n- **Granite Plaza**: Frequency 1\n- **Moonlit Promenade**: Frequency 4\n- **Evergreen Circle**: Frequency 1\n- **Ironbridge Crossing**: Frequency 3\n- **Westgate Station**: Frequency 1\n- **King’s Row**: Frequency 2\n\nThis ensures optimal frequency allocation for the Wi-Fi base stations while minimizing interference."

The goal is to allocate frequencies to Wi-Fi base stations represented as nodes in an undirected graph, ensuring that no two adjacent stations (which may interfere with each other) are assigned the same frequency.\n\n### Algorithm Used\n- **Algorithm**: Coloring Backtracking Algorithm\n- **Complexity**: O(2^n), suitable for smaller graphs (in this case, 13 stations).\n\n### Tool's Output\nThe output from the graph coloring algorithm is as follows:\n- **Number of Colors Used**: 5\n- **Color Assignment**: \n  - Haven Docks (0): Color 1\n  - Copper Clock Square (1): Color 1\n  - Jade Fountain (2): Color 1\n  - Primrose Boulevard (3): Color 1\n  - Brass Lantern Tavern (4): Color 2\n  - Knight’s Market (5): Color 1\n  - Echo Station (6): Color 3\n  - Zenith Arena (7): Color 2\n  - Amber Plaza (8): Color 4\n  - Cobalt Market (9): Color 5\n  - Shadowbridge Arcade (10): Color 4\n  - Willowshade Pavilion (11): Color 4\n  - Sapphire Arena (12): Color 3\n\n### Analysis of the Output\nThe algorithm successfully assigned frequencies (colors) to the Wi-Fi base stations while ensuring that no two adjacent stations share the same frequency. The total number of different frequencies used is 5.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe optimal frequency allocation for the Wi-Fi base stations is as follows:\n- **Total Frequencies Used**: 5\n- **Color Assignments**:\n  - Haven Docks: Frequency 1\n  - Copper Clock Square: Frequency 1\n  - Jade Fountain: Frequency 1\n  - Primrose Boulevard: Frequency 1\n  - Brass Lantern Tavern: Frequency 2\n  - Knight’s Market: Frequency 1\n  - Echo Station: Frequency 3\n  - Zenith Arena: Frequency 2\n  - Amber Plaza: Frequency 4\n  - Cobalt Market: Frequency 5\n  - Shadowbridge Arcade: Frequency 4\n  - Willowshade Pavilion: Frequency 4\n  - Sapphire Arena: Frequency 3\n\nThis allocation ensures optimal frequency usage while preventing interference between adjacent stations."

  "response": "### Problem Summary\nThe task is to solve the Graph Coloring problem using the Greedy Coloring Algorithm. The goal is to assign frequencies to Wi-Fi base stations represented as nodes in an undirected graph, ensuring that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency. This is crucial for minimizing interference in the network.\n\n### Algorithm Used\nThe algorithm employed for this problem is the **Graph Coloring** algorithm, specifically using backtracking to find a valid coloring of the graph.\n\n### Tool Output\nThe output from the graph coloring algorithm is as follows:\n- **Number of Colors Used**: 4\n- **Color Assignment**: \n  - Yarrow Plaza (0): Color 1\n  - Granite Plaza (1): Color 1\n  - Quartz District (2): Color 2\n  - Jasper Marina (3): Color 3\n  - Skyline Gardens (4): Color 2\n  - Nimbus Plaza (5): Color 4\n  - Jade Fountain (6): Color 1\n  - Oakshade Library (7): Color 3\n  - Zenith Arena (8): Color 2\n  - Primrose Boulevard (9): Color 2\n  - Amber Plaza (10): Color 2\n  - Gilded Archway (11): Color 4\n  - Lighthouse Point (12): Color 4\n\n### Analysis of the Output\nThe algorithm successfully assigned 4 different colors to the 13 base stations while ensuring that no two adjacent stations share the same color. This means that the frequency allocation is efficient, minimizing potential interference.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe optimal frequency allocation for the Wi-Fi base stations is as follows:\n- **Yarrow Plaza**: Frequency 1\n- **Granite Plaza**: Frequency 1\n- **Quartz District**: Frequency 2\n- **Jasper Marina**: Frequency 3\n- **Skyline Gardens**: Frequency 2\n- **Nimbus Plaza**: Frequency 4\n- **Jade Fountain**: Frequency 1\n- **Oakshade Library**: Frequency 3\n- **Zenith Arena**: Frequency 2\n- **Primrose Boulevard**: Frequency 2\n- **Amber Plaza**: Frequency 2\n- **Gilded Archway**: Frequency 4\n- **Lighthouse Point**: Frequency 4\n\nThis allocation ensures that adjacent base stations do not interfere with each other's signals."
