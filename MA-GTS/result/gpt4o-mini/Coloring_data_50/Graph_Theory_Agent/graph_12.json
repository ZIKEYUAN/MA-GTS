The **Coloring Backtracking Algorithm** is suitable for this size of the graph.\n\n4. **Output Dictionary**:\n```python\n{\n    \"problem\": \"Graph Coloring\",\n    \"algorithm\": \"Coloring Backtracking Algorithm\",\n    \"parameters\": {\n        \"adjacency_list\": \"An undirected graph representing the connections between Wi-Fi base stations.\"\n    },\n    \"complexity\": \"O(2^n), where n is the number of vertices. This algorithm is optimal for small graphs but can become slow for larger instances.\",\n    \"description\": \"The Coloring Backtracking Algorithm is the best choice for this problem because it systematically explores all possible colorings and guarantees finding the minimal number of frequencies needed to avoid interference among adjacent Wi-Fi base stations.\"\n}\n```"

  "response": "Based on the provided text and problem information, we can analyze the graph's scale and characteristics, and select the most suitable graph algorithm.\n\n1. **Graph Characteristics**:\n   - The graph represents the 12 major locations (nodes) where Wi-Fi base stations are installed.\n   - The problem involves assigning frequencies to these stations while minimizing interference, which can be modeled as a graph coloring problem. Each station is a node, and an edge exists between two nodes if their signal areas overlap (i.e., they are adjacent).\n\n2. **Graph Size**:\n   - The number of nodes (Wi-Fi base stations) is 12, which is less than 25. This indicates that we can use an optimal solution for graph coloring.\n\n3. **Problem Type**:\n   - The problem is a graph coloring problem, where we need to assign colors (frequencies) to nodes (base stations) such that no two adjacent nodes share the same color.\n\n4. **Selected Algorithm**:\n   - Given that the graph has fewer than 25 nodes, the **Coloring Backtracking Algorithm** is the most suitable choice as it provides an optimal solution.\n\n5. **Parameters**:\n   - The parameters required for the algorithm include:\n     - `adjacency_list`: An undirected graph represented as an adjacency matrix or adjacency list, indicating which base stations are adjacent (i.e., have overlapping signal areas).\n\n6. **Complexity**:\n   - The time complexity of the Coloring Backtracking Algorithm is \\(O(2^n)\\), which is feasible for small graphs like this one.\n\n7. **Description**:\n   - The Coloring Backtracking Algorithm is the best choice for this problem because it systematically explores all possible color assignments to find the minimum number of frequencies needed, ensuring that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, thus minimizing interference effectively.\n\nHere is the output in the requested format:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"problem\": \"Graph Coloring\",\n    \"algorithm\": \"Coloring Backtracking Algorithm\",\n    \"parameters\": {\n        \"adjacency_list\": \"An undirected graph represented as an adjacency matrix or adjacency list.\"\n    },\n    \"complexity\": \"O(2^n), where n is the number of vertices, making it suitable for small graphs.\",\n    \"description\": \"The Coloring Backtracking Algorithm is optimal for this problem as it explores all possible color assignments to minimize the number of frequencies needed while ensuring that adjacent stations do not interfere with each other.\"\n}\n```"
