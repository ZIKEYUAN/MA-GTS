This is a classic graph coloring problem.\n\n2. **Problem Type**:\n   - The problem is a **Graph Coloring** problem, where the goal is to assign colors (frequencies) to the nodes (Wi-Fi base stations) such that no two adjacent nodes share the same color.\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - Given that the graph has **11 nodes**, which is less than 20, we should opt for an optimal solution. The **Backtracking** algorithm is suitable for this size of the graph as it can find the minimal coloring number effectively.\n\n4. **Output Dictionary**:\n```json\n{\n    \"problem\": \"Graph Coloring\",\n    \"algorithm\": \"Backtracking\",\n    \"parameters\": {\n        \"adjacency_list\": \"An undirected graph representing the connections between Wi-Fi base stations.\"\n    },\n    \"complexity\": \"O(2^n)\",\n    \"description\": \"The Backtracking algorithm is the best choice for this problem because it systematically explores all possible colorings and ensures that the minimum number of frequencies is used while adhering to the constraints of the problem.\"\n}\n```"

  "response": "Based on the provided information, we can analyze the graph's scale and characteristics, as well as determine the appropriate algorithm to solve the problem of frequency allocation for the Wi-Fi base stations.\n\n### Analysis of Graph Characteristics:\n1. **Scale**: The problem involves 11 major locations (nodes), which means the graph has 11 nodes.\n2. **Characteristics**: The problem is about minimizing interference by ensuring that adjacent nodes (Wi-Fi base stations with overlapping coverage areas) do not use the same frequency. This is a classic graph coloring problem.\n\n### Problem Type:\nThe problem is a **Graph Coloring** problem, where we need to assign colors (frequencies) to nodes (Wi-Fi base stations) such that no two adjacent nodes share the same color.\n\n### Suitable Algorithm Selection:\nGiven that the graph has **11 nodes**, we can choose an optimal solution algorithm since it falls within the range of less than 20 nodes.\n\nThe most suitable algorithm for this problem is the **Backtracking** algorithm, which is optimal for graph coloring problems with small graphs.\n\n### Output Dictionary:\n```json\n{\n    \"problem\": \"Graph Coloring\",\n    \"algorithm\": \"Backtracking\",\n    \"parameters\": {\n        \"adjacency_list\": \"An undirected graph represented as an adjacency matrix or adjacency list.\"\n    },\n    \"complexity\": \"O(2^n)\",\n    \"description\": \"The Backtracking algorithm is the best choice for this problem because it systematically explores all possible color assignments and ensures that the minimum number of frequencies is used while satisfying the constraints of adjacent stations not sharing the same frequency.\"\n}\n```"

This is a classic graph coloring problem.\n\n2. **Problem Type**:\n   - The problem is a **Graph Coloring** problem, where the goal is to minimize the number of colors (frequencies) used to color the graph (assign frequencies to the base stations).\n\n3. **Algorithm Selection**:\n   - Given that there are 11 nodes, we fall under the category of small graphs (less than 20 nodes). Therefore, an optimal solution is preferred.\n   - The **Backtracking** algorithm is suitable for this problem as it uses depth-first search and backtracking to find the minimal coloring number.\n\n4. **Output Dictionary**:\n```json\n{\n    \"problem\": \"Graph Coloring\",\n    \"algorithm\": \"Backtracking\",\n    \"parameters\": {\n        \"adjacency_list\": \"An undirected graph representing the coverage areas of the Wi-Fi base stations.\"\n    },\n    \"complexity\": \"O(2^n)\",\n    \"description\": \"The Backtracking algorithm is the best choice for this problem because it systematically explores all possible colorings of the graph and guarantees finding the optimal solution for the minimal number of frequencies needed.\"\n}\n```"
