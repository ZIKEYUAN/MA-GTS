  "Q": "Our company handles deliveries across a busy urban area, and today we have 13 distinct delivery points to cover. The delivery driver will start from our central warehouse and needs to drop off packages at each location before returning to the warehouse. Since these delivery points are scattered throughout different parts of the city, we’re looking to find the most efficient route to minimize the total distance traveled. This will help us save on fuel, reduce delivery times, and improve our overall efficiency.\nThe warehouse, is located near the city center. Each location represents a different type of business or residential area with unique delivery requirements:\nDragon’s Gate: An iconic stone gate marking the entrance to the vibrant Chinatown district.\nCobalt Market: A vibrant marketplace where merchants sell exotic goods and fresh produce from all over.\nSapphire Arena: A massive sports and concert venue surrounded by restaurants and fan zones.\nHaven Docks: The city’s bustling port area, filled with cargo ships, seafood stalls, and lively taverns.\nTwilight Harbor: A picturesque dock area with twinkling lights and waterfront dining.\nAzure Gardens: An expansive botanical garden featuring rare plants, greenhouses, and water features.\nSkyline Gardens: A rooftop garden atop the central mall, offering breathtaking views and quiet retreats.\nOakshade Library: The city’s largest library, featuring towering bookshelves and cozy reading nooks.\nFlare Alley: A narrow, colorful street lined with neon-lit bars and underground clubs.\nLighthouse Point: A scenic overlook by the bay with a historic lighthouse and picnic spots.\nWillowshade Pavilion: A cultural pavilion hosting open-air art exhibits, food festivals, and community events.\nOpal Theater: An avant-garde cinema showing independent films and hosting film festivals.\nMosaic Plaza: A public square adorned with colorful tile art and surrounded by artisan coffee shops.\n\nEach pair of points has a different travel distance between them, based on city traffic patterns and street layouts.

  "Q": "Our company handles deliveries across a busy urban area, and today we have 13 distinct delivery points to cover. The delivery driver will start from our central warehouse and needs to drop off packages at each location before returning to the warehouse. Since these delivery points are scattered throughout different parts of the city, we’re looking to find the most efficient route to minimize the total distance traveled. This will help us save on fuel, reduce delivery times, and improve our overall efficiency.\nThe warehouse, is located near the city center.

  "Q": "Our company handles deliveries across a busy urban area, and today we have 13 distinct delivery points to cover. The delivery driver will start from our central warehouse and needs to drop off packages at each location before returning to the warehouse. Since these delivery points are scattered throughout different parts of the city, we’re looking to find the most efficient route to minimize the total distance traveled. This will help us save on fuel, reduce delivery times, and improve our overall efficiency.\nThe warehouse, is located near the city center. Each location represents a different type of business or residential area with unique delivery requirements:\nTwilight Harbor: A picturesque dock area with twinkling lights and waterfront dining.\nEcho Station: The city’s largest transportation hub, always alive with the sound of trains and announcements.\nRosewood Hall: A grand event hall hosting galas, weddings, and large conferences.\nNorthwind Tower: A modern skyscraper with a rotating observation deck and sky-high dining.\nIvory Spire Cathedral: A towering cathedral with stunning stained-glass windows and a melodic bell tower.\nOakshade Library: The city’s largest library, featuring towering bookshelves and cozy reading nooks.\nBeacon Tower: The tallest building in the city, offering panoramic views and a rotating rooftop restaurant.\nUmbra Theater: A grand opera house with velvet interiors and a reputation for world-class performances.\nLunar Pier: A picturesque wooden pier with food stalls, fishing spots, and a small amusement park.\nFlare Alley: A narrow, colorful street lined with neon-lit bars and underground clubs.\nUnion Square Market: A farmers’ market offering fresh produce, handmade crafts, and live music.\nZenith Arena: A state-of-the-art stadium for concerts, sports events, and major public gatherings.\nKing’s Row: A luxurious shopping street lined with high-end stores and designer boutiques.\n\nEach pair of points has a different travel distance between them, based on city traffic patterns and street layouts.

This will help us save on fuel, reduce delivery times, and improve our overall efficiency.\nThe warehouse, is located near the city center. Each location represents a different type of business or residential area with unique delivery requirements:\nGranite Plaza: A corporate plaza with water fountains and benches, popular among office workers during lunch.\nDragon’s Gate: An iconic stone gate marking the entrance to the vibrant Chinatown district.\nPrimrose Boulevard: A tree-lined street with boutique stores, local bakeries, and street performers.\nKing’s Row: A luxurious shopping street lined with high-end stores and designer boutiques.\nBeacon Tower: The tallest building in the city, offering panoramic views and a rotating rooftop restaurant.\nFlint Forge Quarter: An old industrial area now revitalized with art studios and trendy cafes.\nJasper Marina: A sleek marina hosting luxury yachts, seafood dining, and weekend sailing lessons.\nTwilight Harbor: A picturesque dock area with twinkling lights and waterfront dining.\nLunar Pier: A picturesque wooden pier with food stalls, fishing spots, and a small amusement park.\nPennywhistle Arcade: A vintage entertainment district with old-style theaters, arcades, and street performers.\nAmber Plaza: A bustling central square surrounded by cafes, boutiques, and street performers.\nWestgate Station: A major train terminal, connecting the city to nearby towns and regions.\nCobalt Market: A vibrant marketplace where merchants sell exotic goods and fresh produce from all over.\n\nEach pair of points has a different travel distance between them, based on city traffic patterns and street layouts.

  "Q": "Our company handles deliveries across a busy urban area, and today we have 13 distinct delivery points to cover. The delivery driver will start from our central warehouse and needs to drop off packages at each location before returning to the warehouse. Since these delivery points are scattered throughout different parts of the city, we’re looking to find the most efficient route to minimize the total distance traveled. This will help us save on fuel, reduce delivery times, and improve our overall efficiency.\nThe warehouse, is located near the city center. Each location represents a different type of business or residential area with unique delivery requirements:\nShadowbridge Arcade: A covered walkway filled with specialty stores, cafes, and hidden speakeasies.\nZenith Arena: A state-of-the-art stadium for concerts, sports events, and major public gatherings.\nAzure Gardens: An expansive botanical garden featuring rare plants, greenhouses, and water features.\nBeacon Tower: The tallest building in the city, offering panoramic views and a rotating rooftop restaurant.\nLunar Pier: A picturesque wooden pier with food stalls, fishing spots, and a small amusement park.\nJasper Marina: A sleek marina hosting luxury yachts, seafood dining, and weekend sailing lessons.\nDuskwood Park: A sprawling urban park filled with dense trees, walking trails, and a serene lake.\nNorthwind Tower: A modern skyscraper with a rotating observation deck and sky-high dining.\nKing’s Row: A luxurious shopping street lined with high-end stores and designer boutiques.\nUmbra Theater: A grand opera house with velvet interiors and a reputation for world-class performances.\nFlint Forge Quarter: An old industrial area now revitalized with art studios and trendy cafes.\nUnion Square Market: A farmers’ market offering fresh produce, handmade crafts, and live music.\nVelvet Corner: A hidden alley filled with cozy cafes, second-hand bookstores, and intimate music venues.\n\nEach pair of points has a different travel distance between them, based on city traffic patterns and street layouts.

  "Q": "Our company handles deliveries across a busy urban area, and today we have 13 distinct delivery points to cover. The delivery driver will start from our central warehouse and needs to drop off packages at each location before returning to the warehouse. Since these delivery points are scattered throughout different parts of the city, we’re looking to find the most efficient route to minimize the total distance traveled. This will help us save on fuel, reduce delivery times, and improve our overall efficiency.\nThe warehouse, is located near the city center. Each location represents a different type of business or residential area with unique delivery requirements:\nYarrow Plaza: A cultural hub with art galleries, street food stalls, and live performances every evening.\nEvergreen Circle: A quiet residential park with a children’s playground and small community events.\nNorthwind Tower: A modern skyscraper with a rotating observation deck and sky-high dining.\nKing’s Row: A luxurious shopping street lined with high-end stores and designer boutiques.\nOpal Theater: An avant-garde cinema showing independent films and hosting film festivals.\nCobalt Market: A vibrant marketplace where merchants sell exotic goods and fresh produce from all over.\nMaplewood Conservatory: A sprawling indoor botanical garden with exotic plants and tranquil waterfalls.\nLunar Pier: A picturesque wooden pier with food stalls, fishing spots, and a small amusement park.\nUmbra Theater: A grand opera house with velvet interiors and a reputation for world-class performances.\nAmber Plaza: A bustling central square surrounded by cafes, boutiques, and street performers.\nNimbus Plaza: A futuristic square surrounded by glass skyscrapers and interactive digital art installations.\nKnight’s Market: A medieval-themed marketplace with handcrafted goods and costumed vendors.\nJasper Marina: A sleek marina hosting luxury yachts, seafood dining, and weekend sailing lessons.\n\nEach pair of points has a different travel distance between them, based on city traffic patterns and street layouts.
