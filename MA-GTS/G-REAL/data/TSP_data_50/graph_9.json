  "Q": "Our company handles deliveries across a busy urban area, and today we have 9 distinct delivery points to cover. The delivery driver will start from our central warehouse and needs to drop off packages at each location before returning to the warehouse. Since these delivery points are scattered throughout different parts of the city, we’re looking to find the most efficient route to minimize the total distance traveled. This will help us save on fuel, reduce delivery times, and improve our overall efficiency.\nThe warehouse, is located near the city center. Each location represents a different type of business or residential area with unique delivery requirements:\nRiverstone Wharf: A bustling area along the river, known for its floating markets and seafood restaurants.\nHaven Docks: The city’s bustling port area, filled with cargo ships, seafood stalls, and lively taverns.\nFlint Forge Quarter: An old industrial area now revitalized with art studios and trendy cafes.\nIvory Spire Cathedral: A towering cathedral with stunning stained-glass windows and a melodic bell tower.\nJasper Marina: A sleek marina hosting luxury yachts, seafood dining, and weekend sailing lessons.\nPennywhistle Arcade: A vintage entertainment district with old-style theaters, arcades, and street performers.\nLunar Pier: A picturesque wooden pier with food stalls, fishing spots, and a small amusement park.\nSapphire Arena: A massive sports and concert venue surrounded by restaurants and fan zones.\nTemple Square: A historic site featuring a grand temple surrounded by artisan shops and open courtyards.\n\nEach pair of points has a different travel distance between them, based on city traffic patterns and street layouts.

This will help us save on fuel, reduce delivery times, and improve our overall efficiency.\nThe warehouse, is located near the city center. Each location represents a different type of business or residential area with unique delivery requirements:\nLunar Pier: A picturesque wooden pier with food stalls, fishing spots, and a small amusement park.\nSkyline Gardens: A rooftop garden atop the central mall, offering breathtaking views and quiet retreats.\nMaplewood Conservatory: A sprawling indoor botanical garden with exotic plants and tranquil waterfalls.\nYarrow Plaza: A cultural hub with art galleries, street food stalls, and live performances every evening.\nRosewood Hall: A grand event hall hosting galas, weddings, and large conferences.\nSilvercrest Observatory: A high-tech observatory where visitors can stargaze and learn about astronomy.\nEvergreen Circle: A quiet residential park with a children’s playground and small community events.\nHorizon Mall: A massive indoor shopping center with everything from luxury brands to casual dining.\nUnion Square Market: A farmers’ market offering fresh produce, handmade crafts, and live music.\n\nEach pair of points has a different travel distance between them, based on city traffic patterns and street layouts.

This will help us save on fuel, reduce delivery times, and improve our overall efficiency.\nThe warehouse, is located near the city center. Each location represents a different type of business or residential area with unique delivery requirements:\nWestgate Station: A major train terminal, connecting the city to nearby towns and regions.\nOpal Theater: An avant-garde cinema showing independent films and hosting film festivals.\nAmber Plaza: A bustling central square surrounded by cafes, boutiques, and street performers.\nAzure Gardens: An expansive botanical garden featuring rare plants, greenhouses, and water features.\nWillowshade Pavilion: A cultural pavilion hosting open-air art exhibits, food festivals, and community events.\nIvory Spire Cathedral: A towering cathedral with stunning stained-glass windows and a melodic bell tower.\nGranite Plaza: A corporate plaza with water fountains and benches, popular among office workers during lunch.\nSilvercrest Observatory: A high-tech observatory where visitors can stargaze and learn about astronomy.\nYarrow Plaza: A cultural hub with art galleries, street food stalls, and live performances every evening.\n\nEach pair of points has a different travel distance between them, based on city traffic patterns and street layouts.

  "Q": "Our company handles deliveries across a busy urban area, and today we have 9 distinct delivery points to cover. The delivery driver will start from our central warehouse and needs to drop off packages at each location before returning to the warehouse. Since these delivery points are scattered throughout different parts of the city, we’re looking to find the most efficient route to minimize the total distance traveled. This will help us save on fuel, reduce delivery times, and improve our overall efficiency.\nThe warehouse, is located near the city center. Each location represents a different type of business or residential area with unique delivery requirements:\nLighthouse Point: A scenic overlook by the bay with a historic lighthouse and picnic spots.\nHaven Docks: The city’s bustling port area, filled with cargo ships, seafood stalls, and lively taverns.\nMosaic Plaza: A public square adorned with colorful tile art and surrounded by artisan coffee shops.\nMoonlit Promenade: A romantic walkway along the riverbank, lit by soft lanterns at night.\nDragon’s Gate: An iconic stone gate marking the entrance to the vibrant Chinatown district.\nQuarry Point: An old quarry turned into a unique rock-climbing park and open-air amphitheater.\nWillowshade Pavilion: A cultural pavilion hosting open-air art exhibits, food festivals, and community events.\nAmber Plaza: A bustling central square surrounded by cafes, boutiques, and street performers.\nIvory Spire Cathedral: A towering cathedral with stunning stained-glass windows and a melodic bell tower.\n\nEach pair of points has a different travel distance between them, based on city traffic patterns and street layouts.
