  "Q": "Our company handles deliveries across a busy urban area, and today we have 3 distinct delivery points to cover. The delivery driver will start from our central warehouse and needs to drop off packages at each location before returning to the warehouse. Since these delivery points are scattered throughout different parts of the city, we’re looking to find the most efficient route to minimize the total distance traveled. This will help us save on fuel, reduce delivery times, and improve our overall efficiency.\nThe warehouse, is located near the city center. Each location represents a different type of business or residential area with unique delivery requirements:\nRosewood Hall: A grand event hall hosting galas, weddings, and large conferences.\nSilvercrest Observatory: A high-tech observatory where visitors can stargaze and learn about astronomy.\nPennywhistle Arcade: A vintage entertainment district with old-style theaters, arcades, and street performers.\n\nEach pair of points has a different travel distance between them, based on city traffic patterns and street layouts. Here is the distance table showing the approximate distance (in kilometers) between each pair of locations:\nDistances from Warehouse to each delivery point: Warehouse to Rosewood Hall is 5 km, Warehouse to Silvercrest Observatory is 5 km, Warehouse to Pennywhistle Arcade is 5 km.\nDistances from Delivery Rosewood Hall to each delivery point: Rosewood Hall to Silvercrest Observatory is 8 km, Rosewood Hall to Pennywhistle Arcade is 4 km.\nDistances from Delivery Silvercrest Observatory to each delivery point: Silvercrest Observatory to Pennywhistle Arcade is 8 km.\n\nBased on this distance table, we need to determine the optimal delivery route that allows the driver to start from the warehouse, visit each delivery point exactly once, and return to warehouse with the shortest possible total distance.",

  "Q": "Our company handles deliveries across a busy urban area, and today we have 3 distinct delivery points to cover. The delivery driver will start from our central warehouse and needs to drop off packages at each location before returning to the warehouse. Since these delivery points are scattered throughout different parts of the city, we’re looking to find the most efficient route to minimize the total distance traveled. This will help us save on fuel, reduce delivery times, and improve our overall efficiency.\nThe warehouse, is located near the city center. Each location represents a different type of business or residential area with unique delivery requirements:\nTwilight Harbor: A picturesque dock area with twinkling lights and waterfront dining.\nKnight’s Market: A medieval-themed marketplace with handcrafted goods and costumed vendors.\nSilvercrest Observatory: A high-tech observatory where visitors can stargaze and learn about astronomy.\n\nEach pair of points has a different travel distance between them, based on city traffic patterns and street layouts. Here is the distance table showing the approximate distance (in kilometers) between each pair of locations:\nDistances from Warehouse to each delivery point: Warehouse to Twilight Harbor is 8 km, Warehouse to Knight’s Market is 1 km, Warehouse to Silvercrest Observatory is 3 km.\nDistances from Delivery Twilight Harbor to each delivery point: Twilight Harbor to Knight’s Market is 10 km, Twilight Harbor to Silvercrest Observatory is 8 km.\nDistances from Delivery Knight’s Market to each delivery point: Knight’s Market to Silvercrest Observatory is 7 km.\n\nBased on this distance table, we need to determine the optimal delivery route that allows the driver to start from the warehouse, visit each delivery point exactly once, and return to warehouse with the shortest possible total distance.",

  "Q": "Our company handles deliveries across a busy urban area, and today we have 3 distinct delivery points to cover. The delivery driver will start from our central warehouse and needs to drop off packages at each location before returning to the warehouse. Since these delivery points are scattered throughout different parts of the city, we’re looking to find the most efficient route to minimize the total distance traveled. This will help us save on fuel, reduce delivery times, and improve our overall efficiency.\nThe warehouse, is located near the city center. Each location represents a different type of business or residential area with unique delivery requirements:\nTemple Square: A historic site featuring a grand temple surrounded by artisan shops and open courtyards.\nSkyline Gardens: A rooftop garden atop the central mall, offering breathtaking views and quiet retreats.\nFlare Alley: A narrow, colorful street lined with neon-lit bars and underground clubs.\n\nEach pair of points has a different travel distance between them, based on city traffic patterns and street layouts. Here is the distance table showing the approximate distance (in kilometers) between each pair of locations:\nDistances from Warehouse to each delivery point: Warehouse to Temple Square is 1 km, Warehouse to Skyline Gardens is 9 km, Warehouse to Flare Alley is 2 km.\nDistances from Delivery Temple Square to each delivery point: Temple Square to Skyline Gardens is 4 km, Temple Square to Flare Alley is 10 km.\nDistances from Delivery Skyline Gardens to each delivery point: Skyline Gardens to Flare Alley is 2 km.\n\nBased on this distance table, we need to determine the optimal delivery route that allows the driver to start from the warehouse, visit each delivery point exactly once, and return to warehouse with the shortest possible total distance.",
