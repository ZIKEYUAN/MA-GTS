  "Q": "Our company handles deliveries across a busy urban area, and today we have 11 distinct delivery points to cover. The delivery driver will start from our central warehouse and needs to drop off packages at each location before returning to the warehouse.

This will help us save on fuel, reduce delivery times, and improve our overall efficiency.\nThe warehouse, is located near the city center. Each location represents a different type of business or residential area with unique delivery requirements:\nDuskwood Park: A sprawling urban park filled with dense trees, walking trails, and a serene lake.\nShadowbridge Arcade: A covered walkway filled with specialty stores, cafes, and hidden speakeasies.\nIronbridge Crossing: A massive steel bridge connecting the industrial zone with the city center.\nVelvet Corner: A hidden alley filled with cozy cafes, second-hand bookstores, and intimate music venues.\nOakshade Library: The city’s largest library, featuring towering bookshelves and cozy reading nooks.\nMaplewood Conservatory: A sprawling indoor botanical garden with exotic plants and tranquil waterfalls.\nAmber Plaza: A bustling central square surrounded by cafes, boutiques, and street performers.\nHorizon Mall: A massive indoor shopping center with everything from luxury brands to casual dining.\nMoonlit Promenade: A romantic walkway along the riverbank, lit by soft lanterns at night.\nTwilight Harbor: A picturesque dock area with twinkling lights and waterfront dining.\nTemple Square: A historic site featuring a grand temple surrounded by artisan shops and open courtyards.\n\nEach pair of points has a different travel distance between them, based on city traffic patterns and street layouts.

The delivery driver will start from our central warehouse and needs to drop off packages at each location before returning to the warehouse. Since these delivery points are scattered throughout different parts of the city, we’re looking to find the most efficient route to minimize the total distance traveled. This will help us save on fuel, reduce delivery times, and improve our overall efficiency.\nThe warehouse, is located near the city center. Each location represents a different type of business or residential area with unique delivery requirements:\nMosaic Plaza: A public square adorned with colorful tile art and surrounded by artisan coffee shops.\nShadowbridge Arcade: A covered walkway filled with specialty stores, cafes, and hidden speakeasies.\nOpal Theater: An avant-garde cinema showing independent films and hosting film festivals.\nLunar Pier: A picturesque wooden pier with food stalls, fishing spots, and a small amusement park.\nSilvercrest Observatory: A high-tech observatory where visitors can stargaze and learn about astronomy.\nPennywhistle Arcade: A vintage entertainment district with old-style theaters, arcades, and street performers.\nHorizon Mall: A massive indoor shopping center with everything from luxury brands to casual dining.\nMoonlit Promenade: A romantic walkway along the riverbank, lit by soft lanterns at night.\nQuarry Point: An old quarry turned into a unique rock-climbing park and open-air amphitheater.\nUnion Square Market: A farmers’ market offering fresh produce, handmade crafts, and live music.\nQuartz District: A modern financial center with sleek skyscrapers and luxury dining establishments.\n\nEach pair of points has a different travel distance between them, based on city traffic patterns and street layouts.

  "Q": "Our company handles deliveries across a busy urban area, and today we have 11 distinct delivery points to cover. The delivery driver will start from our central warehouse and needs to drop off packages at each location before returning to the warehouse. Since these delivery points are scattered throughout different parts of the city, we’re looking to find the most efficient route to minimize the total distance traveled. This will help us save on fuel, reduce delivery times, and improve our overall efficiency.\nThe warehouse, is located near the city center. Each location represents a different type of business or residential area with unique delivery requirements:\nGilded Archway: A historic landmark leading to the city’s oldest district, adorned with intricate carvings.\nKnight’s Market: A medieval-themed marketplace with handcrafted goods and costumed vendors.\nSkyline Gardens: A rooftop garden atop the central mall, offering breathtaking views and quiet retreats.\nEcho Station: The city’s largest transportation hub, always alive with the sound of trains and announcements.\nOakshade Library: The city’s largest library, featuring towering bookshelves and cozy reading nooks.\nDragon’s Gate: An iconic stone gate marking the entrance to the vibrant Chinatown district.\nMoonlit Promenade: A romantic walkway along the riverbank, lit by soft lanterns at night.\nSilvercrest Observatory: A high-tech observatory where visitors can stargaze and learn about astronomy.\nIvory Spire Cathedral: A towering cathedral with stunning stained-glass windows and a melodic bell tower.\nSapphire Arena: A massive sports and concert venue surrounded by restaurants and fan zones.\nFlint Forge Quarter: An old industrial area now revitalized with art studios and trendy cafes.\n\nEach pair of points has a different travel distance between them, based on city traffic patterns and street layouts.

  "Q": "Our company handles deliveries across a busy urban area, and today we have 11 distinct delivery points to cover. The delivery driver will start from our central warehouse and needs to drop off packages at each location before returning to the warehouse.

This will help us save on fuel, reduce delivery times, and improve our overall efficiency.\nThe warehouse, is located near the city center.

This will help us save on fuel, reduce delivery times, and improve our overall efficiency.\nThe warehouse, is located near the city center.
