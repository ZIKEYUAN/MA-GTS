  "Q": "Our company handles deliveries across a busy urban area, and today we have 12 distinct delivery points to cover. The delivery driver will start from our central warehouse and needs to drop off packages at each location before returning to the warehouse. Since these delivery points are scattered throughout different parts of the city, we’re looking to find the most efficient route to minimize the total distance traveled. This will help us save on fuel, reduce delivery times, and improve our overall efficiency.\nThe warehouse, is located near the city center. Each location represents a different type of business or residential area with unique delivery requirements:\nKing’s Row: A luxurious shopping street lined with high-end stores and designer boutiques.\nNimbus Plaza: A futuristic square surrounded by glass skyscrapers and interactive digital art installations.\nGilded Archway: A historic landmark leading to the city’s oldest district, adorned with intricate carvings.\nTemple Square: A historic site featuring a grand temple surrounded by artisan shops and open courtyards.\nFlint Forge Quarter: An old industrial area now revitalized with art studios and trendy cafes.\nAmber Plaza: A bustling central square surrounded by cafes, boutiques, and street performers.\nHaven Docks: The city’s bustling port area, filled with cargo ships, seafood stalls, and lively taverns.\nKnight’s Market: A medieval-themed marketplace with handcrafted goods and costumed vendors.\nSkyline Gardens: A rooftop garden atop the central mall, offering breathtaking views and quiet retreats.\nNorthwind Tower: A modern skyscraper with a rotating observation deck and sky-high dining.\nQuarry Point: An old quarry turned into a unique rock-climbing park and open-air amphitheater.\nJasper Marina: A sleek marina hosting luxury yachts, seafood dining, and weekend sailing lessons.\n\nEach pair of points has a different travel distance between them, based on city traffic patterns and street layouts.

  "Q": "Our company handles deliveries across a busy urban area, and today we have 12 distinct delivery points to cover. The delivery driver will start from our central warehouse and needs to drop off packages at each location before returning to the warehouse. Since these delivery points are scattered throughout different parts of the city, we’re looking to find the most efficient route to minimize the total distance traveled. This will help us save on fuel, reduce delivery times, and improve our overall efficiency.\nThe warehouse, is located near the city center. Each location represents a different type of business or residential area with unique delivery requirements:\nKnight’s Market: A medieval-themed marketplace with handcrafted goods and costumed vendors.\nYarrow Plaza: A cultural hub with art galleries, street food stalls, and live performances every evening.\nKing’s Row: A luxurious shopping street lined with high-end stores and designer boutiques.\nBrass Lantern Tavern: A cozy pub famous for its handcrafted beers and warm, rustic interiors.\nIronbridge Crossing: A massive steel bridge connecting the industrial zone with the city center.\nHaven Docks: The city’s bustling port area, filled with cargo ships, seafood stalls, and lively taverns.\nFlare Alley: A narrow, colorful street lined with neon-lit bars and underground clubs.\nCobalt Market: A vibrant marketplace where merchants sell exotic goods and fresh produce from all over.\nZenith Arena: A state-of-the-art stadium for concerts, sports events, and major public gatherings.\nQuarry Point: An old quarry turned into a unique rock-climbing park and open-air amphitheater.\nCopper Clock Square: A historic plaza with a towering clock surrounded by antique shops and cafes.\nNimbus Plaza: A futuristic square surrounded by glass skyscrapers and interactive digital art installations.\n\nEach pair of points has a different travel distance between them, based on city traffic patterns and street layouts.

  "Q": "Our company handles deliveries across a busy urban area, and today we have 12 distinct delivery points to cover. The delivery driver will start from our central warehouse and needs to drop off packages at each location before returning to the warehouse. Since these delivery points are scattered throughout different parts of the city, we’re looking to find the most efficient route to minimize the total distance traveled. This will help us save on fuel, reduce delivery times, and improve our overall efficiency.\nThe warehouse, is located near the city center. Each location represents a different type of business or residential area with unique delivery requirements:\nHorizon Mall: A massive indoor shopping center with everything from luxury brands to casual dining.\nPennywhistle Arcade: A vintage entertainment district with old-style theaters, arcades, and street performers.\nSilvercrest Observatory: A high-tech observatory where visitors can stargaze and learn about astronomy.\nCobalt Market: A vibrant marketplace where merchants sell exotic goods and fresh produce from all over.\nJasper Marina: A sleek marina hosting luxury yachts, seafood dining, and weekend sailing lessons.\nAmber Plaza: A bustling central square surrounded by cafes, boutiques, and street performers.\nYarrow Plaza: A cultural hub with art galleries, street food stalls, and live performances every evening.\nUmbra Theater: A grand opera house with velvet interiors and a reputation for world-class performances.\nCopper Clock Square: A historic plaza with a towering clock surrounded by antique shops and cafes.\nMosaic Plaza: A public square adorned with colorful tile art and surrounded by artisan coffee shops.\nNimbus Plaza: A futuristic square surrounded by glass skyscrapers and interactive digital art installations.\nQuarry Point: An old quarry turned into a unique rock-climbing park and open-air amphitheater.\n\nEach pair of points has a different travel distance between them, based on city traffic patterns and street layouts.
