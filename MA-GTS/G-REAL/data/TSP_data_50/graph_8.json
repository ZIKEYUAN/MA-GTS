  "Q": "Our company handles deliveries across a busy urban area, and today we have 8 distinct delivery points to cover. The delivery driver will start from our central warehouse and needs to drop off packages at each location before returning to the warehouse. Since these delivery points are scattered throughout different parts of the city, we’re looking to find the most efficient route to minimize the total distance traveled. This will help us save on fuel, reduce delivery times, and improve our overall efficiency.\nThe warehouse, is located near the city center. Each location represents a different type of business or residential area with unique delivery requirements:\nAmber Plaza: A bustling central square surrounded by cafes, boutiques, and street performers.\nFlare Alley: A narrow, colorful street lined with neon-lit bars and underground clubs.\nAzure Gardens: An expansive botanical garden featuring rare plants, greenhouses, and water features.\nGranite Plaza: A corporate plaza with water fountains and benches, popular among office workers during lunch.\nVelvet Corner: A hidden alley filled with cozy cafes, second-hand bookstores, and intimate music venues.\nQuarry Point: An old quarry turned into a unique rock-climbing park and open-air amphitheater.\nGilded Archway: A historic landmark leading to the city’s oldest district, adorned with intricate carvings.\nNorthwind Tower: A modern skyscraper with a rotating observation deck and sky-high dining.\n\nEach pair of points has a different travel distance between them, based on city traffic patterns and street layouts.

This will help us save on fuel, reduce delivery times, and improve our overall efficiency.\nThe warehouse, is located near the city center. Each location represents a different type of business or residential area with unique delivery requirements:\nOakshade Library: The city’s largest library, featuring towering bookshelves and cozy reading nooks.\nIronbridge Crossing: A massive steel bridge connecting the industrial zone with the city center.\nWillowshade Pavilion: A cultural pavilion hosting open-air art exhibits, food festivals, and community events.\nCobalt Market: A vibrant marketplace where merchants sell exotic goods and fresh produce from all over.\nUmbra Theater: A grand opera house with velvet interiors and a reputation for world-class performances.\nKing’s Row: A luxurious shopping street lined with high-end stores and designer boutiques.\nDragon’s Gate: An iconic stone gate marking the entrance to the vibrant Chinatown district.\nWestgate Station: A major train terminal, connecting the city to nearby towns and regions.\n\nEach pair of points has a different travel distance between them, based on city traffic patterns and street layouts.

  "Q": "Our company handles deliveries across a busy urban area, and today we have 8 distinct delivery points to cover. The delivery driver will start from our central warehouse and needs to drop off packages at each location before returning to the warehouse. Since these delivery points are scattered throughout different parts of the city, we’re looking to find the most efficient route to minimize the total distance traveled. This will help us save on fuel, reduce delivery times, and improve our overall efficiency.\nThe warehouse, is located near the city center. Each location represents a different type of business or residential area with unique delivery requirements:\nOakshade Library: The city’s largest library, featuring towering bookshelves and cozy reading nooks.\nTwilight Harbor: A picturesque dock area with twinkling lights and waterfront dining.\nQuarry Point: An old quarry turned into a unique rock-climbing park and open-air amphitheater.\nAmber Plaza: A bustling central square surrounded by cafes, boutiques, and street performers.\nTemple Square: A historic site featuring a grand temple surrounded by artisan shops and open courtyards.\nWestgate Station: A major train terminal, connecting the city to nearby towns and regions.\nEcho Station: The city’s largest transportation hub, always alive with the sound of trains and announcements.\nMaplewood Conservatory: A sprawling indoor botanical garden with exotic plants and tranquil waterfalls.\n\nEach pair of points has a different travel distance between them, based on city traffic patterns and street layouts.

  "Q": "Our company handles deliveries across a busy urban area, and today we have 8 distinct delivery points to cover. The delivery driver will start from our central warehouse and needs to drop off packages at each location before returning to the warehouse. Since these delivery points are scattered throughout different parts of the city, we’re looking to find the most efficient route to minimize the total distance traveled. This will help us save on fuel, reduce delivery times, and improve our overall efficiency.\nThe warehouse, is located near the city center. Each location represents a different type of business or residential area with unique delivery requirements:\nJasper Marina: A sleek marina hosting luxury yachts, seafood dining, and weekend sailing lessons.\nIvory Spire Cathedral: A towering cathedral with stunning stained-glass windows and a melodic bell tower.\nQuartz District: A modern financial center with sleek skyscrapers and luxury dining establishments.\nTwilight Harbor: A picturesque dock area with twinkling lights and waterfront dining.\nEvergreen Circle: A quiet residential park with a children’s playground and small community events.\nEcho Station: The city’s largest transportation hub, always alive with the sound of trains and announcements.\nUnion Square Market: A farmers’ market offering fresh produce, handmade crafts, and live music.\nFlare Alley: A narrow, colorful street lined with neon-lit bars and underground clubs.\n\nEach pair of points has a different travel distance between them, based on city traffic patterns and street layouts.

This will help us save on fuel, reduce delivery times, and improve our overall efficiency.\nThe warehouse, is located near the city center. Each location represents a different type of business or residential area with unique delivery requirements:\nRosewood Hall: A grand event hall hosting galas, weddings, and large conferences.\nHorizon Mall: A massive indoor shopping center with everything from luxury brands to casual dining.\nFlare Alley: A narrow, colorful street lined with neon-lit bars and underground clubs.\nFlint Forge Quarter: An old industrial area now revitalized with art studios and trendy cafes.\nVelvet Corner: A hidden alley filled with cozy cafes, second-hand bookstores, and intimate music venues.\nGilded Archway: A historic landmark leading to the city’s oldest district, adorned with intricate carvings.\nLunar Pier: A picturesque wooden pier with food stalls, fishing spots, and a small amusement park.\nRiverstone Wharf: A bustling area along the river, known for its floating markets and seafood restaurants.\n\nEach pair of points has a different travel distance between them, based on city traffic patterns and street layouts.

  "Q": "Our company handles deliveries across a busy urban area, and today we have 8 distinct delivery points to cover. The delivery driver will start from our central warehouse and needs to drop off packages at each location before returning to the warehouse. Since these delivery points are scattered throughout different parts of the city, we’re looking to find the most efficient route to minimize the total distance traveled. This will help us save on fuel, reduce delivery times, and improve our overall efficiency.\nThe warehouse, is located near the city center. Each location represents a different type of business or residential area with unique delivery requirements:\nIvory Spire Cathedral: A towering cathedral with stunning stained-glass windows and a melodic bell tower.\nFlint Forge Quarter: An old industrial area now revitalized with art studios and trendy cafes.\nAmber Plaza: A bustling central square surrounded by cafes, boutiques, and street performers.\nDragon’s Gate: An iconic stone gate marking the entrance to the vibrant Chinatown district.\nSkyline Gardens: A rooftop garden atop the central mall, offering breathtaking views and quiet retreats.\nHaven Docks: The city’s bustling port area, filled with cargo ships, seafood stalls, and lively taverns.\nLunar Pier: A picturesque wooden pier with food stalls, fishing spots, and a small amusement park.\nEvergreen Circle: A quiet residential park with a children’s playground and small community events.\n\nEach pair of points has a different travel distance between them, based on city traffic patterns and street layouts.

  "Q": "Our company handles deliveries across a busy urban area, and today we have 8 distinct delivery points to cover. The delivery driver will start from our central warehouse and needs to drop off packages at each location before returning to the warehouse. Since these delivery points are scattered throughout different parts of the city, we’re looking to find the most efficient route to minimize the total distance traveled. This will help us save on fuel, reduce delivery times, and improve our overall efficiency.\nThe warehouse, is located near the city center. Each location represents a different type of business or residential area with unique delivery requirements:\nIvory Spire Cathedral: A towering cathedral with stunning stained-glass windows and a melodic bell tower.\nUnion Square Market: A farmers’ market offering fresh produce, handmade crafts, and live music.\nQuarry Point: An old quarry turned into a unique rock-climbing park and open-air amphitheater.\nOakshade Library: The city’s largest library, featuring towering bookshelves and cozy reading nooks.\nShadowbridge Arcade: A covered walkway filled with specialty stores, cafes, and hidden speakeasies.\nGranite Plaza: A corporate plaza with water fountains and benches, popular among office workers during lunch.\nMoonlit Promenade: A romantic walkway along the riverbank, lit by soft lanterns at night.\nRosewood Hall: A grand event hall hosting galas, weddings, and large conferences.\n\nEach pair of points has a different travel distance between them, based on city traffic patterns and street layouts.

This will help us save on fuel, reduce delivery times, and improve our overall efficiency.\nThe warehouse, is located near the city center. Each location represents a different type of business or residential area with unique delivery requirements:\nMosaic Plaza: A public square adorned with colorful tile art and surrounded by artisan coffee shops.\nPennywhistle Arcade: A vintage entertainment district with old-style theaters, arcades, and street performers.\nKing’s Row: A luxurious shopping street lined with high-end stores and designer boutiques.\nPrimrose Boulevard: A tree-lined street with boutique stores, local bakeries, and street performers.\nOpal Theater: An avant-garde cinema showing independent films and hosting film festivals.\nSilvercrest Observatory: A high-tech observatory where visitors can stargaze and learn about astronomy.\nIvory Spire Cathedral: A towering cathedral with stunning stained-glass windows and a melodic bell tower.\nUnion Square Market: A farmers’ market offering fresh produce, handmade crafts, and live music.\n\nEach pair of points has a different travel distance between them, based on city traffic patterns and street layouts.

  "Q": "Our company handles deliveries across a busy urban area, and today we have 8 distinct delivery points to cover. The delivery driver will start from our central warehouse and needs to drop off packages at each location before returning to the warehouse. Since these delivery points are scattered throughout different parts of the city, we’re looking to find the most efficient route to minimize the total distance traveled. This will help us save on fuel, reduce delivery times, and improve our overall efficiency.\nThe warehouse, is located near the city center. Each location represents a different type of business or residential area with unique delivery requirements:\nQuarry Point: An old quarry turned into a unique rock-climbing park and open-air amphitheater.\nUnion Square Market: A farmers’ market offering fresh produce, handmade crafts, and live music.\nHaven Docks: The city’s bustling port area, filled with cargo ships, seafood stalls, and lively taverns.\nRosewood Hall: A grand event hall hosting galas, weddings, and large conferences.\nSkyline Gardens: A rooftop garden atop the central mall, offering breathtaking views and quiet retreats.\nBeacon Tower: The tallest building in the city, offering panoramic views and a rotating rooftop restaurant.\nYarrow Plaza: A cultural hub with art galleries, street food stalls, and live performances every evening.\nCopper Clock Square: A historic plaza with a towering clock surrounded by antique shops and cafes.\n\nEach pair of points has a different travel distance between them, based on city traffic patterns and street layouts.

This will help us save on fuel, reduce delivery times, and improve our overall efficiency.\nThe warehouse, is located near the city center. Each location represents a different type of business or residential area with unique delivery requirements:\nTwilight Harbor: A picturesque dock area with twinkling lights and waterfront dining.\nHaven Docks: The city’s bustling port area, filled with cargo ships, seafood stalls, and lively taverns.\nPrimrose Boulevard: A tree-lined street with boutique stores, local bakeries, and street performers.\nUmbra Theater: A grand opera house with velvet interiors and a reputation for world-class performances.\nIronbridge Crossing: A massive steel bridge connecting the industrial zone with the city center.\nShadowbridge Arcade: A covered walkway filled with specialty stores, cafes, and hidden speakeasies.\nMoonlit Promenade: A romantic walkway along the riverbank, lit by soft lanterns at night.\nFlint Forge Quarter: An old industrial area now revitalized with art studios and trendy cafes.\n\nEach pair of points has a different travel distance between them, based on city traffic patterns and street layouts.

  "Q": "Our company handles deliveries across a busy urban area, and today we have 8 distinct delivery points to cover. The delivery driver will start from our central warehouse and needs to drop off packages at each location before returning to the warehouse. Since these delivery points are scattered throughout different parts of the city, we’re looking to find the most efficient route to minimize the total distance traveled. This will help us save on fuel, reduce delivery times, and improve our overall efficiency.\nThe warehouse, is located near the city center. Each location represents a different type of business or residential area with unique delivery requirements:\nFlint Forge Quarter: An old industrial area now revitalized with art studios and trendy cafes.\nSapphire Arena: A massive sports and concert venue surrounded by restaurants and fan zones.\nHorizon Mall: A massive indoor shopping center with everything from luxury brands to casual dining.\nAzure Gardens: An expansive botanical garden featuring rare plants, greenhouses, and water features.\nMaplewood Conservatory: A sprawling indoor botanical garden with exotic plants and tranquil waterfalls.\nIvory Spire Cathedral: A towering cathedral with stunning stained-glass windows and a melodic bell tower.\nJade Fountain: A tranquil plaza centered around a beautiful fountain made of green stone.\nDragon’s Gate: An iconic stone gate marking the entrance to the vibrant Chinatown district.\n\nEach pair of points has a different travel distance between them, based on city traffic patterns and street layouts. Here is the distance table showing the approximate distance (in kilometers) between each pair of locations:\nDistances from Warehouse to each delivery point: Warehouse to Flint Forge Quarter is 10 km, Warehouse to Sapphire Arena is 3 km, Warehouse to Horizon Mall is 10 km, Warehouse to Azure Gardens is 3 km, Warehouse to Maplewood Conservatory is 5 km, Warehouse to Ivory Spire Cathedral is 9 km, Warehouse to Jade Fountain is 7 km, Warehouse to Dragon’s Gate is 4 km.\nDistances from Delivery Flint Forge Quarter to each delivery point: Flint Forge Quarter to Sapphire Arena is 3 km, Flint Forge Quarter to Horizon Mall is 4 km, Flint Forge Quarter to Azure Gardens is 4 km, Flint Forge Quarter to Maplewood Conservatory is 10 km, Flint Forge Quarter to Ivory Spire Cathedral is 5 km, Flint Forge Quarter to Jade Fountain is 5 km, Flint Forge Quarter to Dragon’s Gate is 8 km.\nDistances from Delivery Sapphire Arena to each delivery point: Sapphire Arena to Horizon Mall is 2 km, Sapphire Arena to Azure Gardens is 2 km, Sapphire Arena to Maplewood Conservatory is 10 km, Sapphire Arena to Ivory Spire Cathedral is 2 km, Sapphire Arena to Jade Fountain is 2 km, Sapphire Arena to Dragon’s Gate is 8 km.\nDistances from Delivery Horizon Mall to each delivery point: Horizon Mall to Azure Gardens is 5 km, Horizon Mall to Maplewood Conservatory is 9 km, Horizon Mall to Ivory Spire Cathedral is 10 km, Horizon Mall to Jade Fountain is 5 km, Horizon Mall to Dragon’s Gate is 1 km.\nDistances from Delivery Azure Gardens to each delivery point: Azure Gardens to Maplewood Conservatory is 1 km, Azure Gardens to Ivory Spire Cathedral is 3 km, Azure Gardens to Jade Fountain is 9 km, Azure Gardens to Dragon’s Gate is 7 km.\nDistances from Delivery Maplewood Conservatory to each delivery point: Maplewood Conservatory to Ivory Spire Cathedral is 6 km, Maplewood Conservatory to Jade Fountain is 10 km, Maplewood Conservatory to Dragon’s Gate is 10 km.\nDistances from Delivery Ivory Spire Cathedral to each delivery point: Ivory Spire Cathedral to Jade Fountain is 10 km, Ivory Spire Cathedral to Dragon’s Gate is 6 km.\nDistances from Delivery Jade Fountain to each delivery point: Jade Fountain to Dragon’s Gate is 4 km.\n\nBased on this distance table, we need to determine the optimal delivery route that allows the driver to start from the warehouse, visit each delivery point exactly once, and return to warehouse with the shortest possible total distance.",
