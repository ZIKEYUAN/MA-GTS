  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 14 major locations in the city: Opal Theater, Westgate Station, Quarry Point, Sapphire Arena, Knight’s Market, Mosaic Plaza, Pennywhistle Arcade, Oakshade Library, Quartz District, Skyline Gardens, Velvet Corner, Twilight Harbor, Granite Plaza and Willowshade Pavilion. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Opal Theater has overlapping signal areas with Westgate Station, Knight’s Market, Mosaic Plaza, Skyline Gardens, Twilight Harbor, Willowshade Pavilion. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena, Pennywhistle Arcade, Quartz District, Granite Plaza, Willowshade Pavilion. \nThe Quarry Point has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena, Quartz District, Skyline Gardens, Velvet Corner, Granite Plaza, Willowshade Pavilion. \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade, Quartz District, Twilight Harbor. \nThe Knight’s Market has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza, Quartz District, Willowshade Pavilion. \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Oakshade Library, Skyline Gardens, Twilight Harbor, Granite Plaza, Willowshade Pavilion. \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens. \nThe Oakshade Library has overlapping signal areas with Quartz District, Skyline Gardens, Twilight Harbor, Granite Plaza. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens, Velvet Corner, Twilight Harbor. \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Twilight Harbor. \nThe Velvet Corner has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza. \nThe Twilight Harbor has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference.

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 14 major locations in the city: Oakshade Library, Lighthouse Point, Skyline Gardens, Silvercrest Observatory, Beacon Tower, Velvet Corner, Horizon Mall, Jasper Marina, Flare Alley, Lunar Pier, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Knight’s Market, Quartz District and Primrose Boulevard. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Oakshade Library has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens, Velvet Corner, Jasper Marina, Flare Alley, Lunar Pier, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Quartz District. \nThe Lighthouse Point has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens, Silvercrest Observatory, Beacon Tower, Velvet Corner, Horizon Mall, Flare Alley, Lunar Pier. \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower, Velvet Corner, Horizon Mall, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with Horizon Mall, Jasper Marina, Flare Alley, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Knight’s Market. \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with Velvet Corner, Jasper Marina, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Velvet Corner has overlapping signal areas with Flare Alley, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Flare Alley, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Jasper Marina has overlapping signal areas with Flare Alley, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Quartz District. \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Knight’s Market, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Lunar Pier has overlapping signal areas with Quartz District. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Knight’s Market, Quartz District. \nThe Knight’s Market has overlapping signal areas with Quartz District. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 14 major locations in the city: Pennywhistle Arcade, Jasper Marina, Primrose Boulevard, Cobalt Market, Velvet Corner, Evergreen Circle, Skyline Gardens, Azure Gardens, Nimbus Plaza, Granite Plaza, Sapphire Arena, Rosewood Hall, Knight’s Market and Gilded Archway. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Primrose Boulevard, Cobalt Market, Velvet Corner, Evergreen Circle, Granite Plaza, Sapphire Arena, Gilded Archway. \nThe Jasper Marina has overlapping signal areas with Cobalt Market, Skyline Gardens, Sapphire Arena, Rosewood Hall, Knight’s Market, Gilded Archway. \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with Velvet Corner, Skyline Gardens, Azure Gardens, Rosewood Hall. \nThe Cobalt Market has overlapping signal areas with Evergreen Circle, Nimbus Plaza, Rosewood Hall, Knight’s Market. \nThe Velvet Corner has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza, Sapphire Arena, Rosewood Hall. \nThe Evergreen Circle has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens, Azure Gardens, Nimbus Plaza, Knight’s Market. \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Nimbus Plaza, Knight’s Market. \nThe Azure Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Nimbus Plaza, Rosewood Hall, Gilded Archway. \nThe Nimbus Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza, Gilded Archway. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena, Rosewood Hall, Gilded Archway. \nThe Rosewood Hall has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference.

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 14 major locations in the city: Sapphire Arena, Zenith Arena, Umbra Theater, Oakshade Library, Beacon Tower, Maplewood Conservatory, Union Square Market, Cobalt Market, Silvercrest Observatory, Flint Forge Quarter, Primrose Boulevard, Skyline Gardens, Ivory Spire Cathedral and Pennywhistle Arcade. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with Zenith Arena, Oakshade Library, Beacon Tower, Maplewood Conservatory, Union Square Market, Cobalt Market, Silvercrest Observatory, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Zenith Arena has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater, Oakshade Library, Beacon Tower, Maplewood Conservatory, Union Square Market, Cobalt Market, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Umbra Theater has overlapping signal areas with Oakshade Library, Union Square Market, Flint Forge Quarter, Primrose Boulevard, Skyline Gardens, Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Oakshade Library has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Maplewood Conservatory has overlapping signal areas with Cobalt Market, Flint Forge Quarter, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Union Square Market has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Cobalt Market has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory, Flint Forge Quarter, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with Flint Forge Quarter, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference.

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 14 major locations in the city: Flint Forge Quarter, Maplewood Conservatory, Knight’s Market, Willowshade Pavilion, Sapphire Arena, Oakshade Library, Rosewood Hall, Dragon’s Gate, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Cobalt Market, Primrose Boulevard, King’s Row, Velvet Corner and Evergreen Circle. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena, Rosewood Hall, Dragon’s Gate, Primrose Boulevard, Velvet Corner. \nThe Maplewood Conservatory has overlapping signal areas with Knight’s Market, Oakshade Library, King’s Row. \nThe Knight’s Market has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Sapphire Arena, Oakshade Library, Dragon’s Gate, Cobalt Market, Primrose Boulevard, Evergreen Circle. \nThe Willowshade Pavilion has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena, Oakshade Library, Rosewood Hall, Dragon’s Gate, Cobalt Market, King’s Row, Velvet Corner, Evergreen Circle. \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with Rosewood Hall, Dragon’s Gate, Primrose Boulevard, King’s Row, Velvet Corner. \nThe Oakshade Library has overlapping signal areas with Evergreen Circle. \nThe Rosewood Hall has overlapping signal areas with Cobalt Market, Velvet Corner, Evergreen Circle. \nThe Dragon’s Gate has overlapping signal areas with Velvet Corner. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row. \nThe Cobalt Market has overlapping signal areas with Primrose Boulevard, King’s Row, Velvet Corner. \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row. \nThe Velvet Corner has overlapping signal areas with Evergreen Circle. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference.

The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Knight’s Market has overlapping signal areas with Nimbus Plaza, Zenith Arena, Evergreen Circle, Jasper Marina, Haven Docks. \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Quarry Point, Evergreen Circle, Jasper Marina, Horizon Mall, Union Square Market. \nThe Nimbus Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade, Zenith Arena, Jasper Marina, Horizon Mall, Union Square Market, Maplewood Conservatory, Haven Docks. \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina, Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Quarry Point has overlapping signal areas with Horizon Mall, Union Square Market, Haven Docks. \nThe Zenith Arena has overlapping signal areas with Evergreen Circle, Copper Clock Square, Horizon Mall, Union Square Market, Haven Docks. \nThe Evergreen Circle has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina, Copper Clock Square, Horizon Mall, Union Square Market, Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Jasper Marina has overlapping signal areas with Union Square Market. \nThe Copper Clock Square has overlapping signal areas with Horizon Mall, Union Square Market, Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Union Square Market. \nThe Union Square Market has overlapping signal areas with Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Riverstone Wharf has overlapping signal areas with Haven Docks. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",
