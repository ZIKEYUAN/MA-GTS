  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas.

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 7 major locations in the city: Quartz District, Lunar Pier, Temple Square, Zenith Arena, Westgate Station, Yarrow Plaza and Flint Forge Quarter. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier, Temple Square, Zenith Arena, Westgate Station. \nThe Lunar Pier has overlapping signal areas with Temple Square, Yarrow Plaza. \nThe Temple Square has overlapping signal areas with Zenith Arena, Flint Forge Quarter. \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Flint Forge Quarter. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",
