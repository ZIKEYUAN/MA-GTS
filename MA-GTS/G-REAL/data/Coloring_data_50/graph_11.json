  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 11 major locations in the city: Amber Plaza, Silvercrest Observatory, Azure Gardens, Temple Square, Knight’s Market, Echo Station, Flare Alley, Evergreen Circle, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Cobalt Market and Willowshade Pavilion. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Temple Square, Echo Station, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Cobalt Market. \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with Temple Square, Echo Station, Evergreen Circle. \nThe Azure Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Temple Square, Knight’s Market, Flare Alley, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Temple Square has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station, Evergreen Circle, Cobalt Market, Willowshade Pavilion. \nThe Knight’s Market has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station, Flare Alley, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Willowshade Pavilion. \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with Flare Alley, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Evergreen Circle, Willowshade Pavilion. \nThe Evergreen Circle has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference.

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 11 major locations in the city: Shadowbridge Arcade, Duskwood Park, Temple Square, Willowshade Pavilion, Westgate Station, Jasper Marina, Sapphire Arena, Copper Clock Square, Cobalt Market, Amber Plaza and Umbra Theater. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Shadowbridge Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina, Copper Clock Square, Cobalt Market, Amber Plaza, Umbra Theater. \nThe Temple Square has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Jasper Marina, Sapphire Arena, Cobalt Market, Amber Plaza, Umbra Theater. \nThe Willowshade Pavilion has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina, Umbra Theater. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina, Copper Clock Square, Amber Plaza. \nThe Jasper Marina has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with Copper Clock Square, Cobalt Market, Umbra Theater. \nThe Copper Clock Square has overlapping signal areas with Cobalt Market, Amber Plaza, Umbra Theater. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",
