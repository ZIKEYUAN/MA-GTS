  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 12 major locations in the city: Pennywhistle Arcade, Rosewood Hall, Lighthouse Point, Union Square Market, Jasper Marina, Copper Clock Square, Evergreen Circle, Knight’s Market, Willowshade Pavilion, Flint Forge Quarter, Yarrow Plaza and King’s Row. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Evergreen Circle, Willowshade Pavilion, Yarrow Plaza. \nThe Rosewood Hall has overlapping signal areas with Union Square Market, Jasper Marina, Knight’s Market, Willowshade Pavilion, Yarrow Plaza, King’s Row. \nThe Lighthouse Point has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina, Copper Clock Square, Evergreen Circle, King’s Row. \nThe Union Square Market has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina, Copper Clock Square, Knight’s Market, Willowshade Pavilion, Flint Forge Quarter, King’s Row. \nThe Jasper Marina has overlapping signal areas with Copper Clock Square, Evergreen Circle, Knight’s Market, Flint Forge Quarter, Yarrow Plaza. \nThe Copper Clock Square has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row. \nThe Willowshade Pavilion has overlapping signal areas with Flint Forge Quarter, King’s Row. \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 12 major locations in the city: Oakshade Library, Copper Clock Square, Lunar Pier, Opal Theater, Willowshade Pavilion, Twilight Harbor, Evergreen Circle, Moonlit Promenade, Sapphire Arena, Horizon Mall, King’s Row and Northwind Tower. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Oakshade Library has overlapping signal areas with Copper Clock Square, Opal Theater, Willowshade Pavilion, Moonlit Promenade, Horizon Mall, Northwind Tower. \nThe Copper Clock Square has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Twilight Harbor, Evergreen Circle. \nThe Lunar Pier has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater, Willowshade Pavilion, Evergreen Circle, Moonlit Promenade, Horizon Mall, King’s Row. \nThe Opal Theater has overlapping signal areas with Twilight Harbor, Sapphire Arena, King’s Row, Northwind Tower. \nThe Willowshade Pavilion has overlapping signal areas with Twilight Harbor, King’s Row. \nThe Twilight Harbor has overlapping signal areas with Moonlit Promenade, Northwind Tower. \nThe Evergreen Circle has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower. \nThe Moonlit Promenade has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Northwind Tower. \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with Horizon Mall. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 12 major locations in the city: Velvet Corner, Shadowbridge Arcade, Echo Station, Temple Square, Union Square Market, Sapphire Arena, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Beacon Tower, Moonlit Promenade, Gilded Archway, Opal Theater and Dragon’s Gate. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Velvet Corner has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade, Echo Station, Temple Square, Sapphire Arena, Opal Theater, Dragon’s Gate. \nThe Shadowbridge Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Temple Square, Sapphire Arena, Gilded Archway. \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with Temple Square, Union Square Market, Sapphire Arena, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Beacon Tower. \nThe Temple Square has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower, Moonlit Promenade, Gilded Archway. \nThe Union Square Market has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Gilded Archway, Opal Theater. \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower, Moonlit Promenade, Opal Theater. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway. \nThe Moonlit Promenade has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway. \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

The network will cover 12 major locations in the city: Echo Station, Velvet Corner, Quartz District, Haven Docks, Flint Forge Quarter, Knight’s Market, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Riverstone Wharf, Granite Plaza, Moonlit Promenade, Horizon Mall and Northwind Tower. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with Quartz District, Knight’s Market, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Riverstone Wharf, Granite Plaza. \nThe Velvet Corner has overlapping signal areas with Flint Forge Quarter, Northwind Tower. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Haven Docks, Flint Forge Quarter, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Haven Docks has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral, Riverstone Wharf, Granite Plaza, Horizon Mall. \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Riverstone Wharf, Northwind Tower. \nThe Knight’s Market has overlapping signal areas with Riverstone Wharf, Granite Plaza, Moonlit Promenade, Northwind Tower. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza, Northwind Tower. \nThe Riverstone Wharf has overlapping signal areas with Moonlit Promenade, Horizon Mall. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Moonlit Promenade, Northwind Tower. \nThe Moonlit Promenade has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 12 major locations in the city: Horizon Mall, Flare Alley, Zenith Arena, Opal Theater, Ironbridge Crossing, Westgate Station, Nimbus Plaza, Twilight Harbor, Duskwood Park, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Haven Docks and Azure Gardens. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater, Westgate Station, Twilight Harbor, Duskwood Park. \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater, Westgate Station, Twilight Harbor, Duskwood Park, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Haven Docks. \nThe Zenith Arena has overlapping signal areas with Westgate Station, Duskwood Park, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Opal Theater has overlapping signal areas with Westgate Station, Nimbus Plaza, Duskwood Park, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Ironbridge Crossing has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral, Haven Docks. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Nimbus Plaza, Haven Docks, Azure Gardens. \nThe Twilight Harbor has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral, Haven Docks, Azure Gardens. \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Haven Docks, Azure Gardens. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 12 major locations in the city: Willowshade Pavilion, Lunar Pier, Flare Alley, Sapphire Arena, Horizon Mall, Granite Plaza, Yarrow Plaza, Flint Forge Quarter, Pennywhistle Arcade, King’s Row, Ironbridge Crossing and Mosaic Plaza. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Willowshade Pavilion has overlapping signal areas with Horizon Mall, Yarrow Plaza, Pennywhistle Arcade, Mosaic Plaza. \nThe Lunar Pier has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza, Flint Forge Quarter, King’s Row, Ironbridge Crossing. \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Horizon Mall, Pennywhistle Arcade, Mosaic Plaza. \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza, Flint Forge Quarter, Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, Pennywhistle Arcade, King’s Row, Mosaic Plaza. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row. \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Flint Forge Quarter, Pennywhistle Arcade, King’s Row, Ironbridge Crossing. \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza. \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Mosaic Plaza. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Ironbridge Crossing, Mosaic Plaza. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 12 major locations in the city: Opal Theater, Jade Fountain, Maplewood Conservatory, Granite Plaza, Pennywhistle Arcade, Twilight Harbor, Dragon’s Gate, Primrose Boulevard, Union Square Market, Temple Square, Velvet Corner and Lunar Pier. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Opal Theater has overlapping signal areas with Jade Fountain, Pennywhistle Arcade, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Jade Fountain has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade, Twilight Harbor, Primrose Boulevard, Union Square Market, Lunar Pier. \nThe Maplewood Conservatory has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade, Primrose Boulevard, Velvet Corner, Lunar Pier. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Dragon’s Gate, Temple Square. \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Dragon’s Gate, Union Square Market, Velvet Corner, Lunar Pier. \nThe Twilight Harbor has overlapping signal areas with Dragon’s Gate, Primrose Boulevard, Temple Square. \nThe Dragon’s Gate has overlapping signal areas with Temple Square, Velvet Corner, Lunar Pier. \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with Velvet Corner. \nThe Union Square Market has overlapping signal areas with Temple Square. \nThe Temple Square has overlapping signal areas with Velvet Corner, Lunar Pier. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 12 major locations in the city: Sapphire Arena, Brass Lantern Tavern, Jasper Marina, Amber Plaza, King’s Row, Knight’s Market, Duskwood Park, Skyline Gardens, Haven Docks, Beacon Tower, Maplewood Conservatory and Rosewood Hall. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina, Duskwood Park, Haven Docks, Beacon Tower, Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina, Amber Plaza, King’s Row, Knight’s Market, Skyline Gardens, Haven Docks, Beacon Tower, Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Jasper Marina has overlapping signal areas with Amber Plaza, Beacon Tower, Rosewood Hall. \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens, Rosewood Hall. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Haven Docks. \nThe Knight’s Market has overlapping signal areas with Haven Docks, Beacon Tower, Maplewood Conservatory, Rosewood Hall. \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens, Haven Docks. \nThe Haven Docks has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower. \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Maplewood Conservatory has overlapping signal areas with Rosewood Hall. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 12 major locations in the city: King’s Row, Primrose Boulevard, Duskwood Park, Haven Docks, Evergreen Circle, Gilded Archway, Azure Gardens, Sapphire Arena, Echo Station, Zenith Arena, Westgate Station and Union Square Market. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Primrose Boulevard, Duskwood Park, Azure Gardens, Zenith Arena, Union Square Market. \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park, Haven Docks, Evergreen Circle, Gilded Archway, Azure Gardens, Echo Station, Zenith Arena. \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Evergreen Circle, Sapphire Arena, Echo Station, Westgate Station. \nThe Haven Docks has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway, Union Square Market. \nThe Evergreen Circle has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway, Union Square Market. \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Zenith Arena. \nThe Azure Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Zenith Arena, Union Square Market. \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with Zenith Arena, Westgate Station. \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with Zenith Arena, Westgate Station. \nThe Zenith Arena has overlapping signal areas with Westgate Station. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 12 major locations in the city: Lighthouse Point, Ironbridge Crossing, Granite Plaza, Yarrow Plaza, Velvet Corner, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Shadowbridge Arcade, Sapphire Arena, Twilight Harbor, Westgate Station, Echo Station and Opal Theater. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference.

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 12 major locations in the city: Velvet Corner, Sapphire Arena, Amber Plaza, Beacon Tower, Maplewood Conservatory, Flare Alley, Willowshade Pavilion, Umbra Theater, Shadowbridge Arcade, Opal Theater, Granite Plaza and Nimbus Plaza. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Velvet Corner has overlapping signal areas with Flare Alley, Shadowbridge Arcade, Opal Theater, Granite Plaza. \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with Amber Plaza, Beacon Tower, Maplewood Conservatory, Willowshade Pavilion, Shadowbridge Arcade. \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Maplewood Conservatory, Willowshade Pavilion, Granite Plaza. \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Umbra Theater, Granite Plaza, Nimbus Plaza. \nThe Maplewood Conservatory has overlapping signal areas with Flare Alley, Opal Theater, Granite Plaza. \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade, Granite Plaza, Nimbus Plaza. \nThe Willowshade Pavilion has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater, Nimbus Plaza. \nThe Umbra Theater has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza. \nThe Shadowbridge Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater. \nThe Opal Theater has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza, Nimbus Plaza. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 12 major locations in the city: Brass Lantern Tavern, Echo Station, Mosaic Plaza, Primrose Boulevard, Union Square Market, Zenith Arena, Oakshade Library, Twilight Harbor, King’s Row, Granite Plaza, Umbra Theater and Horizon Mall. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station, Union Square Market, Twilight Harbor, Granite Plaza. \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza, Primrose Boulevard, Union Square Market, Zenith Arena, Twilight Harbor, Granite Plaza. \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Primrose Boulevard, Oakshade Library, King’s Row. \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Horizon Mall. \nThe Union Square Market has overlapping signal areas with Zenith Arena, Oakshade Library, Granite Plaza, Horizon Mall. \nThe Zenith Arena has overlapping signal areas with Twilight Harbor. \nThe Oakshade Library has overlapping signal areas with Twilight Harbor, Granite Plaza, Umbra Theater. \nThe Twilight Harbor has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza, Umbra Theater, Horizon Mall. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Horizon Mall. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 12 major locations in the city: Skyline Gardens, Northwind Tower, Pennywhistle Arcade, Azure Gardens, Mosaic Plaza, Horizon Mall, Union Square Market, Opal Theater, Umbra Theater, Shadowbridge Arcade, Zenith Arena and Twilight Harbor. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza, Horizon Mall, Opal Theater, Umbra Theater, Twilight Harbor. \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade, Azure Gardens, Mosaic Plaza, Horizon Mall, Opal Theater, Zenith Arena, Twilight Harbor. \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Horizon Mall, Umbra Theater, Twilight Harbor. \nThe Azure Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza, Zenith Arena. \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater, Shadowbridge Arcade. \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Union Square Market, Zenith Arena. \nThe Union Square Market has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater, Shadowbridge Arcade, Zenith Arena. \nThe Opal Theater has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade. \nThe Shadowbridge Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Zenith Arena, Twilight Harbor. \nThe Zenith Arena has overlapping signal areas with Twilight Harbor. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 12 major locations in the city: Temple Square, Willowshade Pavilion, Duskwood Park, Sapphire Arena, Oakshade Library, Opal Theater, Westgate Station, Yarrow Plaza, Nimbus Plaza, Maplewood Conservatory, Brass Lantern Tavern and Jasper Marina. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Temple Square has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Oakshade Library, Opal Theater, Nimbus Plaza, Maplewood Conservatory, Brass Lantern Tavern, Jasper Marina. \nThe Willowshade Pavilion has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park, Sapphire Arena, Oakshade Library, Westgate Station, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater, Nimbus Plaza, Brass Lantern Tavern, Jasper Marina. \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with Nimbus Plaza, Brass Lantern Tavern, Jasper Marina. \nThe Oakshade Library has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater, Westgate Station, Yarrow Plaza. \nThe Opal Theater has overlapping signal areas with Maplewood Conservatory, Brass Lantern Tavern, Jasper Marina. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, Nimbus Plaza, Jasper Marina. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",
