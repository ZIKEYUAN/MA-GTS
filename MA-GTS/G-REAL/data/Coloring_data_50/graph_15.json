  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 15 major locations in the city: Rosewood Hall, Beacon Tower, Sapphire Arena, Lighthouse Point, Mosaic Plaza, Copper Clock Square, Azure Gardens, Silvercrest Observatory, Nimbus Plaza, Duskwood Park, Lunar Pier, Cobalt Market, Ironbridge Crossing, Flint Forge Quarter and Westgate Station. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Rosewood Hall has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena, Copper Clock Square, Duskwood Park, Ironbridge Crossing, Flint Forge Quarter. \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza, Copper Clock Square, Azure Gardens, Silvercrest Observatory, Nimbus Plaza, Ironbridge Crossing. \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza, Azure Gardens, Duskwood Park, Lunar Pier, Ironbridge Crossing, Flint Forge Quarter. \nThe Lighthouse Point has overlapping signal areas with Nimbus Plaza, Duskwood Park, Lunar Pier. \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Nimbus Plaza, Flint Forge Quarter, Westgate Station. \nThe Copper Clock Square has overlapping signal areas with Azure Gardens, Silvercrest Observatory, Duskwood Park, Lunar Pier, Cobalt Market. \nThe Azure Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory, Duskwood Park, Cobalt Market, Flint Forge Quarter, Westgate Station. \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with Nimbus Plaza, Lunar Pier, Cobalt Market, Flint Forge Quarter, Westgate Station. \nThe Nimbus Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Flint Forge Quarter, Westgate Station. \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier, Cobalt Market, Flint Forge Quarter, Westgate Station. \nThe Lunar Pier has overlapping signal areas with Flint Forge Quarter. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 15 major locations in the city: Beacon Tower, Riverstone Wharf, Jasper Marina, Haven Docks, Brass Lantern Tavern, Temple Square, Granite Plaza, Yarrow Plaza, Moonlit Promenade, Willowshade Pavilion, Horizon Mall, Gilded Archway, Echo Station, Union Square Market and Azure Gardens. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with Riverstone Wharf, Haven Docks, Brass Lantern Tavern, Willowshade Pavilion, Union Square Market, Azure Gardens. \nThe Riverstone Wharf has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina, Haven Docks, Brass Lantern Tavern, Granite Plaza, Yarrow Plaza, Moonlit Promenade, Willowshade Pavilion, Horizon Mall, Gilded Archway, Echo Station. \nThe Jasper Marina has overlapping signal areas with Temple Square, Echo Station, Union Square Market, Azure Gardens. \nThe Haven Docks has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Granite Plaza, Gilded Archway, Echo Station, Azure Gardens. \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, Horizon Mall, Gilded Archway, Azure Gardens. \nThe Temple Square has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, Willowshade Pavilion, Horizon Mall, Azure Gardens. \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Moonlit Promenade, Willowshade Pavilion, Horizon Mall, Azure Gardens. \nThe Moonlit Promenade has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Echo Station, Azure Gardens. \nThe Willowshade Pavilion has overlapping signal areas with Horizon Mall. \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Union Square Market. \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station. \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with Union Square Market. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 15 major locations in the city: Twilight Harbor, Maplewood Conservatory, Dragon’s Gate, Rosewood Hall, Skyline Gardens, Lunar Pier, Jasper Marina, Duskwood Park, Silvercrest Observatory, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Primrose Boulevard, Willowshade Pavilion, Evergreen Circle, Flare Alley and Horizon Mall. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Twilight Harbor has overlapping signal areas with Rosewood Hall, Skyline Gardens, Jasper Marina, Willowshade Pavilion, Evergreen Circle, Flare Alley. \nThe Maplewood Conservatory has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier, Jasper Marina, Duskwood Park, Silvercrest Observatory. \nThe Dragon’s Gate has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Primrose Boulevard, Willowshade Pavilion, Evergreen Circle, Horizon Mall. \nThe Rosewood Hall has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens, Lunar Pier, Jasper Marina, Silvercrest Observatory, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Willowshade Pavilion, Flare Alley. \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Evergreen Circle. \nThe Lunar Pier has overlapping signal areas with Primrose Boulevard, Evergreen Circle, Flare Alley. \nThe Jasper Marina has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral, Primrose Boulevard, Flare Alley. \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Flare Alley. \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with Evergreen Circle, Horizon Mall. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Primrose Boulevard, Willowshade Pavilion, Evergreen Circle. \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with Evergreen Circle, Horizon Mall. \nThe Willowshade Pavilion has overlapping signal areas with Flare Alley, Horizon Mall. \nThe Evergreen Circle has overlapping signal areas with Flare Alley, Horizon Mall. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference.

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 15 major locations in the city: Ironbridge Crossing, Yarrow Plaza, Echo Station, Evergreen Circle, Jade Fountain, Twilight Harbor, Oakshade Library, Rosewood Hall, Granite Plaza, Moonlit Promenade, Quartz District, Nimbus Plaza, Copper Clock Square, Opal Theater and King’s Row. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Ironbridge Crossing has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, Evergreen Circle, Jade Fountain, Twilight Harbor, Oakshade Library, Moonlit Promenade, Nimbus Plaza, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station, Twilight Harbor, Granite Plaza, Quartz District, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with Evergreen Circle, Quartz District, Nimbus Plaza, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Evergreen Circle has overlapping signal areas with Twilight Harbor, Opal Theater. \nThe Jade Fountain has overlapping signal areas with Oakshade Library, Rosewood Hall, Nimbus Plaza, Opal Theater. \nThe Twilight Harbor has overlapping signal areas with Oakshade Library, Rosewood Hall, Granite Plaza, Moonlit Promenade, Quartz District, Nimbus Plaza. \nThe Oakshade Library has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza, Quartz District, King’s Row. \nThe Rosewood Hall has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza, Quartz District, Nimbus Plaza, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Quartz District, Copper Clock Square, King’s Row. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Nimbus Plaza, Copper Clock Square, Opal Theater, King’s Row. \nThe Copper Clock Square has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row. \nThe Opal Theater has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 15 major locations in the city: Evergreen Circle, Northwind Tower, Velvet Corner, Opal Theater, Riverstone Wharf, Azure Gardens, Dragon’s Gate, Moonlit Promenade, Willowshade Pavilion, Echo Station, Skyline Gardens, Gilded Archway, Temple Square, Pennywhistle Arcade and Flare Alley. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Evergreen Circle has overlapping signal areas with Dragon’s Gate, Moonlit Promenade, Willowshade Pavilion, Echo Station, Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater, Azure Gardens, Moonlit Promenade, Skyline Gardens, Gilded Archway, Pennywhistle Arcade, Flare Alley. \nThe Velvet Corner has overlapping signal areas with Azure Gardens, Moonlit Promenade, Willowshade Pavilion, Temple Square, Flare Alley. \nThe Opal Theater has overlapping signal areas with Dragon’s Gate, Moonlit Promenade, Echo Station, Gilded Archway. \nThe Riverstone Wharf has overlapping signal areas with Azure Gardens, Pennywhistle Arcade, Flare Alley. \nThe Azure Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Dragon’s Gate, Moonlit Promenade, Willowshade Pavilion, Skyline Gardens, Temple Square, Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Dragon’s Gate has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Gilded Archway, Pennywhistle Arcade, Flare Alley. \nThe Moonlit Promenade has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Echo Station, Flare Alley. \nThe Willowshade Pavilion has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station, Temple Square, Flare Alley. \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with Temple Square. \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway, Pennywhistle Arcade, Flare Alley. \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 15 major locations in the city: Maplewood Conservatory, Mosaic Plaza, Flare Alley, Flint Forge Quarter, Umbra Theater, Jasper Marina, Shadowbridge Arcade, Amber Plaza, Rosewood Hall, Oakshade Library, Haven Docks, Brass Lantern Tavern, Pennywhistle Arcade, Yarrow Plaza and Riverstone Wharf. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Maplewood Conservatory has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza, Umbra Theater, Shadowbridge Arcade, Amber Plaza, Rosewood Hall, Oakshade Library, Brass Lantern Tavern, Yarrow Plaza. \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Flare Alley, Umbra Theater, Jasper Marina. \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater, Jasper Marina, Oakshade Library, Haven Docks, Yarrow Plaza, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater, Jasper Marina, Shadowbridge Arcade, Rosewood Hall, Haven Docks, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Umbra Theater has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade, Amber Plaza, Oakshade Library, Haven Docks, Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Jasper Marina has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade, Rosewood Hall, Oakshade Library, Pennywhistle Arcade, Yarrow Plaza. \nThe Shadowbridge Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Oakshade Library, Pennywhistle Arcade, Yarrow Plaza. \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Haven Docks, Brass Lantern Tavern, Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Rosewood Hall has overlapping signal areas with Haven Docks, Yarrow Plaza. \nThe Oakshade Library has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Haven Docks has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Riverstone Wharf. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

The network will cover 15 major locations in the city: Lunar Pier, Evergreen Circle, Brass Lantern Tavern, Primrose Boulevard, Quartz District, Ironbridge Crossing, Silvercrest Observatory, Cobalt Market, Oakshade Library, Jade Fountain, Maplewood Conservatory, Nimbus Plaza, King’s Row, Flint Forge Quarter and Quarry Point. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Lunar Pier has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Primrose Boulevard, Quartz District, Ironbridge Crossing, Silvercrest Observatory, Cobalt Market, Jade Fountain, King’s Row, Quarry Point. \nThe Evergreen Circle has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Quartz District, Ironbridge Crossing, Cobalt Market, Maplewood Conservatory, Flint Forge Quarter, Quarry Point. \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with Quartz District, Ironbridge Crossing, King’s Row. \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with Quartz District, Silvercrest Observatory, Nimbus Plaza, Flint Forge Quarter, Quarry Point. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Oakshade Library, Jade Fountain, Maplewood Conservatory, Nimbus Plaza, King’s Row. \nThe Ironbridge Crossing has overlapping signal areas with Jade Fountain, Maplewood Conservatory, King’s Row, Quarry Point. \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with Cobalt Market, Oakshade Library, Flint Forge Quarter. \nThe Cobalt Market has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Flint Forge Quarter. \nThe Oakshade Library has overlapping signal areas with Quarry Point. \nThe Jade Fountain has overlapping signal areas with Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Maplewood Conservatory has overlapping signal areas with Nimbus Plaza. \nThe Nimbus Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Quarry Point. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Flint Forge Quarter, Quarry Point. \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Quarry Point. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference.

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 15 major locations in the city: Duskwood Park, Temple Square, Copper Clock Square, Zenith Arena, Yarrow Plaza, Granite Plaza, Flare Alley, Pennywhistle Arcade, Skyline Gardens, Union Square Market, Ironbridge Crossing, Azure Gardens, Twilight Harbor, Umbra Theater and King’s Row. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza, Flare Alley, Skyline Gardens, Azure Gardens. \nThe Temple Square has overlapping signal areas with Copper Clock Square, Zenith Arena, Yarrow Plaza, Flare Alley, Azure Gardens, Twilight Harbor, Umbra Theater, King’s Row. \nThe Copper Clock Square has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, Pennywhistle Arcade, Skyline Gardens, Union Square Market, Ironbridge Crossing, Azure Gardens, Twilight Harbor, King’s Row. \nThe Zenith Arena has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza, Flare Alley, Union Square Market, Azure Gardens. \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza, Flare Alley, Pennywhistle Arcade, Skyline Gardens. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens, Ironbridge Crossing, Azure Gardens, Twilight Harbor. \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens, Ironbridge Crossing, King’s Row. \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Union Square Market, Azure Gardens, Umbra Theater. \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Twilight Harbor, King’s Row. \nThe Union Square Market has overlapping signal areas with Azure Gardens, Umbra Theater. \nThe Ironbridge Crossing has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater, King’s Row. \nThe Azure Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Twilight Harbor. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference.

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 15 major locations in the city: Flare Alley, Copper Clock Square, Quartz District, Zenith Arena, Lighthouse Point, Azure Gardens, Cobalt Market, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Duskwood Park, Northwind Tower, Horizon Mall, Haven Docks, Nimbus Plaza, Oakshade Library and Lunar Pier. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Zenith Arena, Lighthouse Point, Cobalt Market, Northwind Tower, Haven Docks, Nimbus Plaza, Lunar Pier. \nThe Copper Clock Square has overlapping signal areas with Quartz District, Zenith Arena, Lighthouse Point, Duskwood Park, Haven Docks, Nimbus Plaza. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Azure Gardens, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Duskwood Park, Northwind Tower, Horizon Mall, Nimbus Plaza, Lunar Pier. \nThe Zenith Arena has overlapping signal areas with Lighthouse Point, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Nimbus Plaza, Oakshade Library. \nThe Lighthouse Point has overlapping signal areas with Azure Gardens, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Duskwood Park, Horizon Mall, Haven Docks, Oakshade Library. \nThe Azure Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower. \nThe Cobalt Market has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, Oakshade Library. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Horizon Mall, Haven Docks, Nimbus Plaza, Oakshade Library, Lunar Pier. \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Horizon Mall, Haven Docks, Lunar Pier. \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier. \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier. \nThe Haven Docks has overlapping signal areas with Oakshade Library. \nThe Nimbus Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

The network will cover 15 major locations in the city: Knight’s Market, Quarry Point, Shadowbridge Arcade, Willowshade Pavilion, Quartz District, Jade Fountain, Westgate Station, Moonlit Promenade, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Lunar Pier, Umbra Theater, Velvet Corner, Yarrow Plaza, Duskwood Park and Primrose Boulevard. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Knight’s Market has overlapping signal areas with Quarry Point, Shadowbridge Arcade. \nThe Quarry Point has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Jade Fountain, Moonlit Promenade, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Umbra Theater, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Shadowbridge Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Quartz District, Jade Fountain, Moonlit Promenade, Lunar Pier, Yarrow Plaza, Duskwood Park. \nThe Willowshade Pavilion has overlapping signal areas with Moonlit Promenade, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Lunar Pier, Umbra Theater, Duskwood Park. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Westgate Station, Velvet Corner, Yarrow Plaza, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Jade Fountain has overlapping signal areas with Westgate Station, Moonlit Promenade, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Umbra Theater, Velvet Corner, Duskwood Park. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Moonlit Promenade, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Yarrow Plaza. \nThe Moonlit Promenade has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral, Umbra Theater, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier, Velvet Corner, Yarrow Plaza. \nThe Lunar Pier has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Umbra Theater has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, Duskwood Park, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Velvet Corner has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park. \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference.

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 15 major locations in the city: Umbra Theater, Zenith Arena, Primrose Boulevard, Azure Gardens, Lunar Pier, Beacon Tower, Quarry Point, Flare Alley, Quartz District, Oakshade Library, King’s Row, Sapphire Arena, Echo Station, Gilded Archway and Nimbus Plaza. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Umbra Theater has overlapping signal areas with Azure Gardens, Quartz District, Sapphire Arena, Gilded Archway, Nimbus Plaza. \nThe Zenith Arena has overlapping signal areas with Azure Gardens, Lunar Pier, Gilded Archway. \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier, Beacon Tower, Quarry Point, Flare Alley, Quartz District, King’s Row, Sapphire Arena, Nimbus Plaza. \nThe Azure Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier, Beacon Tower, Quarry Point, Quartz District, Oakshade Library, Sapphire Arena, Echo Station. \nThe Lunar Pier has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena, Nimbus Plaza. \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with Quarry Point, Flare Alley, Oakshade Library, King’s Row, Echo Station, Gilded Archway, Nimbus Plaza. \nThe Quarry Point has overlapping signal areas with Quartz District, Oakshade Library, King’s Row, Sapphire Arena. \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Quartz District, Gilded Archway. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Oakshade Library, King’s Row, Echo Station. \nThe Oakshade Library has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station, Nimbus Plaza. \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Nimbus Plaza. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 15 major locations in the city: Horizon Mall, Oakshade Library, Amber Plaza, Zenith Arena, Nimbus Plaza, Duskwood Park, Evergreen Circle, Shadowbridge Arcade, Moonlit Promenade, Dragon’s Gate, Brass Lantern Tavern, Pennywhistle Arcade, Mosaic Plaza, Jasper Marina and Jade Fountain. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Nimbus Plaza, Duskwood Park, Evergreen Circle, Moonlit Promenade, Dragon’s Gate, Brass Lantern Tavern, Pennywhistle Arcade, Mosaic Plaza, Jasper Marina. \nThe Oakshade Library has overlapping signal areas with Amber Plaza, Duskwood Park, Shadowbridge Arcade, Moonlit Promenade, Brass Lantern Tavern, Mosaic Plaza, Jasper Marina, Jade Fountain. \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Zenith Arena, Moonlit Promenade, Dragon’s Gate, Brass Lantern Tavern, Pennywhistle Arcade, Jasper Marina. \nThe Zenith Arena has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park, Jasper Marina, Jade Fountain. \nThe Nimbus Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Evergreen Circle, Pennywhistle Arcade, Mosaic Plaza, Jade Fountain. \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Evergreen Circle, Moonlit Promenade, Dragon’s Gate, Mosaic Plaza, Jade Fountain. \nThe Evergreen Circle has overlapping signal areas with Moonlit Promenade, Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Shadowbridge Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade, Jade Fountain. \nThe Moonlit Promenade has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Dragon’s Gate has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Jade Fountain. \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina. \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza, Jasper Marina. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

The network will cover 15 major locations in the city: Granite Plaza, Haven Docks, Lunar Pier, Yarrow Plaza, Jade Fountain, Knight’s Market, Pennywhistle Arcade, Amber Plaza, Opal Theater, Sapphire Arena, Moonlit Promenade, Twilight Harbor, Horizon Mall, Quarry Point and Primrose Boulevard. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Knight’s Market, Pennywhistle Arcade, Amber Plaza, Opal Theater, Moonlit Promenade, Quarry Point. \nThe Haven Docks has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier, Sapphire Arena, Twilight Harbor, Horizon Mall. \nThe Lunar Pier has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, Knight’s Market, Amber Plaza, Horizon Mall, Quarry Point, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Jade Fountain, Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Jade Fountain has overlapping signal areas with Knight’s Market, Pennywhistle Arcade, Twilight Harbor, Horizon Mall, Quarry Point, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Knight’s Market has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater, Sapphire Arena, Twilight Harbor, Horizon Mall. \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Amber Plaza, Sapphire Arena, Moonlit Promenade, Quarry Point. \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater, Moonlit Promenade, Twilight Harbor. \nThe Opal Theater has overlapping signal areas with Horizon Mall. \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with Moonlit Promenade, Twilight Harbor, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Moonlit Promenade has overlapping signal areas with Quarry Point, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Twilight Harbor has overlapping signal areas with Horizon Mall, Quarry Point. \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Quarry Point has overlapping signal areas with Primrose Boulevard. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference.

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 15 major locations in the city: Duskwood Park, Westgate Station, Ironbridge Crossing, Northwind Tower, Zenith Arena, Maplewood Conservatory, Skyline Gardens, Flare Alley, Beacon Tower, Yarrow Plaza, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Pennywhistle Arcade, Jasper Marina, Lunar Pier and Silvercrest Observatory. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Ironbridge Crossing, Northwind Tower, Skyline Gardens, Beacon Tower, Yarrow Plaza, Jasper Marina. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Ironbridge Crossing, Northwind Tower, Zenith Arena, Flare Alley, Beacon Tower, Yarrow Plaza, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Ironbridge Crossing has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, Zenith Arena, Flare Alley, Yarrow Plaza, Pennywhistle Arcade, Jasper Marina. \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with Maplewood Conservatory, Beacon Tower, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Silvercrest Observatory. \nThe Zenith Arena has overlapping signal areas with Maplewood Conservatory, Skyline Gardens, Flare Alley, Beacon Tower, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Silvercrest Observatory. \nThe Maplewood Conservatory has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens, Yarrow Plaza. \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, Silvercrest Observatory. \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral, Pennywhistle Arcade, Silvercrest Observatory. \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, Pennywhistle Arcade, Lunar Pier. \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral, Lunar Pier, Silvercrest Observatory. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory. \nThe Lunar Pier has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 15 major locations in the city: Amber Plaza, Evergreen Circle, Yarrow Plaza, Maplewood Conservatory, Umbra Theater, Flare Alley, Lighthouse Point, Echo Station, Primrose Boulevard, Gilded Archway, Silvercrest Observatory, Azure Gardens, Mosaic Plaza, Jade Fountain and Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, Silvercrest Observatory, Azure Gardens, Mosaic Plaza. \nThe Evergreen Circle has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, Maplewood Conservatory, Lighthouse Point, Gilded Archway. \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Maplewood Conservatory, Umbra Theater, Primrose Boulevard, Gilded Archway, Silvercrest Observatory, Azure Gardens, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Maplewood Conservatory has overlapping signal areas with Lighthouse Point, Primrose Boulevard, Silvercrest Observatory, Azure Gardens, Mosaic Plaza. \nThe Umbra Theater has overlapping signal areas with Flare Alley, Lighthouse Point, Primrose Boulevard, Mosaic Plaza. \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Lighthouse Point, Primrose Boulevard, Jade Fountain, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Lighthouse Point has overlapping signal areas with Primrose Boulevard, Gilded Archway. \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with Primrose Boulevard, Silvercrest Observatory, Azure Gardens, Mosaic Plaza, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway, Azure Gardens, Jade Fountain. \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Azure Gardens. \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with Azure Gardens, Mosaic Plaza, Jade Fountain. \nThe Azure Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza, Jade Fountain. \nThe Jade Fountain has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

The network will cover 15 major locations in the city: Opal Theater, Quartz District, Silvercrest Observatory, Ironbridge Crossing, Nimbus Plaza, Shadowbridge Arcade, Temple Square, Yarrow Plaza, Northwind Tower, Granite Plaza, Lunar Pier, Knight’s Market, Jade Fountain, Oakshade Library and Maplewood Conservatory. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Opal Theater has overlapping signal areas with Quartz District, Ironbridge Crossing, Shadowbridge Arcade, Northwind Tower, Granite Plaza, Lunar Pier, Oakshade Library. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Nimbus Plaza, Shadowbridge Arcade, Temple Square, Granite Plaza, Lunar Pier, Oakshade Library, Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with Ironbridge Crossing, Nimbus Plaza, Temple Square, Yarrow Plaza, Granite Plaza, Jade Fountain, Oakshade Library, Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Ironbridge Crossing has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade, Yarrow Plaza, Jade Fountain, Oakshade Library, Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Nimbus Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza, Knight’s Market, Jade Fountain. \nThe Shadowbridge Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, Northwind Tower, Granite Plaza, Lunar Pier, Knight’s Market, Oakshade Library. \nThe Temple Square has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza, Oakshade Library. \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza, Lunar Pier, Oakshade Library. \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with Knight’s Market, Oakshade Library. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier. \nThe Knight’s Market has overlapping signal areas with Oakshade Library. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 15 major locations in the city: Dragon’s Gate, Maplewood Conservatory, Flint Forge Quarter, Evergreen Circle, Pennywhistle Arcade, Westgate Station, Northwind Tower, Lighthouse Point, Zenith Arena, Ironbridge Crossing, Oakshade Library, Granite Plaza, Flare Alley, Duskwood Park and Nimbus Plaza. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Dragon’s Gate has overlapping signal areas with Oakshade Library, Nimbus Plaza. \nThe Maplewood Conservatory has overlapping signal areas with Westgate Station, Northwind Tower, Lighthouse Point, Zenith Arena, Granite Plaza, Flare Alley, Duskwood Park, Nimbus Plaza. \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Zenith Arena, Ironbridge Crossing, Oakshade Library, Duskwood Park, Nimbus Plaza. \nThe Evergreen Circle has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade, Northwind Tower, Ironbridge Crossing, Granite Plaza, Duskwood Park, Nimbus Plaza. \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Lighthouse Point, Ironbridge Crossing, Oakshade Library. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, Lighthouse Point, Ironbridge Crossing, Oakshade Library, Granite Plaza, Duskwood Park. \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with Lighthouse Point, Zenith Arena, Ironbridge Crossing, Nimbus Plaza. \nThe Lighthouse Point has overlapping signal areas with Zenith Arena, Duskwood Park. \nThe Zenith Arena has overlapping signal areas with Oakshade Library, Duskwood Park, Nimbus Plaza. \nThe Ironbridge Crossing has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza, Flare Alley, Duskwood Park. \nThe Oakshade Library has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza, Nimbus Plaza. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Flare Alley. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",
