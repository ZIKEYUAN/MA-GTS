  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 25 major locations in the city: Ivory Spire Cathedral, Beacon Tower, Maplewood Conservatory, Rosewood Hall, Quartz District, Temple Square, Shadowbridge Arcade, Evergreen Circle, Silvercrest Observatory, Mosaic Plaza, Umbra Theater, Flare Alley, Azure Gardens, Lunar Pier, King’s Row, Brass Lantern Tavern, Twilight Harbor, Oakshade Library, Skyline Gardens, Ironbridge Crossing, Cobalt Market, Amber Plaza, Jade Fountain, Sapphire Arena and Copper Clock Square. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower, Maplewood Conservatory, Rosewood Hall, Quartz District, Shadowbridge Arcade, Silvercrest Observatory, Brass Lantern Tavern, Oakshade Library, Skyline Gardens, Cobalt Market, Amber Plaza, Sapphire Arena, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with Maplewood Conservatory, Rosewood Hall, Temple Square, Shadowbridge Arcade, Evergreen Circle, Mosaic Plaza, Flare Alley, Lunar Pier, Brass Lantern Tavern, Twilight Harbor, Oakshade Library, Ironbridge Crossing, Cobalt Market, Jade Fountain. \nThe Maplewood Conservatory has overlapping signal areas with Evergreen Circle, Silvercrest Observatory, King’s Row, Skyline Gardens, Cobalt Market, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Rosewood Hall has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade, Umbra Theater, Flare Alley, Lunar Pier, Twilight Harbor, Jade Fountain, Sapphire Arena, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade, Evergreen Circle, Mosaic Plaza, Umbra Theater, Azure Gardens, Lunar Pier, King’s Row, Brass Lantern Tavern, Oakshade Library, Amber Plaza, Sapphire Arena. \nThe Temple Square has overlapping signal areas with Flare Alley, Azure Gardens, King’s Row, Brass Lantern Tavern, Skyline Gardens, Cobalt Market, Amber Plaza, Jade Fountain. \nThe Shadowbridge Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Evergreen Circle, Flare Alley, Skyline Gardens, Ironbridge Crossing, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Evergreen Circle has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory, Flare Alley, Lunar Pier, Oakshade Library, Skyline Gardens, Cobalt Market, Amber Plaza, Sapphire Arena. \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza, Flare Alley, Lunar Pier, Twilight Harbor, Jade Fountain, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Twilight Harbor, Ironbridge Crossing, Sapphire Arena, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Umbra Theater has overlapping signal areas with Flare Alley, Azure Gardens, Lunar Pier, Twilight Harbor, Ironbridge Crossing, Cobalt Market, Amber Plaza. \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Twilight Harbor, Amber Plaza. \nThe Azure Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Twilight Harbor, Oakshade Library, Skyline Gardens, Cobalt Market, Sapphire Arena, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Lunar Pier has overlapping signal areas with Twilight Harbor, Cobalt Market, Amber Plaza, Sapphire Arena. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Cobalt Market, Sapphire Arena, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with Twilight Harbor, Oakshade Library, Cobalt Market, Amber Plaza. \nThe Twilight Harbor has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Oakshade Library has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens, Ironbridge Crossing, Sapphire Arena, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Ironbridge Crossing, Cobalt Market, Jade Fountain, Sapphire Arena. \nThe Cobalt Market has overlapping signal areas with Amber Plaza, Jade Fountain. \nThe Jade Fountain has overlapping signal areas with Copper Clock Square. \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with Copper Clock Square. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 25 major locations in the city: King’s Row, Riverstone Wharf, Zenith Arena, Northwind Tower, Westgate Station, Lunar Pier, Moonlit Promenade, Ironbridge Crossing, Gilded Archway, Haven Docks, Granite Plaza, Amber Plaza, Azure Gardens, Jade Fountain, Primrose Boulevard, Duskwood Park, Copper Clock Square, Nimbus Plaza, Brass Lantern Tavern, Mosaic Plaza, Flint Forge Quarter, Knight’s Market, Rosewood Hall, Oakshade Library and Dragon’s Gate. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, Moonlit Promenade, Haven Docks, Duskwood Park, Copper Clock Square, Brass Lantern Tavern, Mosaic Plaza, Flint Forge Quarter. \nThe Riverstone Wharf has overlapping signal areas with Westgate Station, Moonlit Promenade, Haven Docks, Azure Gardens, Jade Fountain, Primrose Boulevard, Flint Forge Quarter, Oakshade Library, Dragon’s Gate. \nThe Zenith Arena has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier, Ironbridge Crossing, Amber Plaza, Azure Gardens, Jade Fountain, Duskwood Park, Brass Lantern Tavern, Mosaic Plaza, Rosewood Hall, Oakshade Library, Dragon’s Gate. \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with Ironbridge Crossing, Gilded Archway, Haven Docks, Azure Gardens, Jade Fountain, Duskwood Park, Nimbus Plaza, Rosewood Hall, Oakshade Library, Dragon’s Gate. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Ironbridge Crossing, Granite Plaza, Amber Plaza, Mosaic Plaza, Flint Forge Quarter, Knight’s Market, Oakshade Library, Dragon’s Gate. \nThe Lunar Pier has overlapping signal areas with Moonlit Promenade, Jade Fountain, Brass Lantern Tavern, Knight’s Market, Rosewood Hall, Dragon’s Gate. \nThe Moonlit Promenade has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza, Jade Fountain, Primrose Boulevard, Copper Clock Square, Brass Lantern Tavern, Flint Forge Quarter, Knight’s Market, Rosewood Hall, Dragon’s Gate. \nThe Ironbridge Crossing has overlapping signal areas with Haven Docks, Jade Fountain, Flint Forge Quarter, Knight’s Market, Rosewood Hall, Dragon’s Gate. \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Amber Plaza, Azure Gardens, Copper Clock Square, Mosaic Plaza, Flint Forge Quarter, Rosewood Hall. \nThe Haven Docks has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza, Amber Plaza, Azure Gardens, Copper Clock Square, Mosaic Plaza, Flint Forge Quarter, Oakshade Library. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park, Copper Clock Square, Brass Lantern Tavern, Rosewood Hall, Oakshade Library. \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park, Copper Clock Square, Brass Lantern Tavern, Mosaic Plaza, Rosewood Hall, Oakshade Library, Dragon’s Gate. \nThe Azure Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park, Mosaic Plaza, Flint Forge Quarter, Dragon’s Gate. \nThe Jade Fountain has overlapping signal areas with Nimbus Plaza, Brass Lantern Tavern, Mosaic Plaza, Flint Forge Quarter, Dragon’s Gate. \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with Rosewood Hall, Oakshade Library. \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Flint Forge Quarter, Rosewood Hall, Oakshade Library, Dragon’s Gate. \nThe Copper Clock Square has overlapping signal areas with Nimbus Plaza, Brass Lantern Tavern, Flint Forge Quarter, Knight’s Market, Oakshade Library, Dragon’s Gate. \nThe Nimbus Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Knight’s Market, Rosewood Hall, Dragon’s Gate. \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with Rosewood Hall. \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Flint Forge Quarter, Knight’s Market, Oakshade Library. \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Knight’s Market, Dragon’s Gate. \nThe Knight’s Market has overlapping signal areas with Dragon’s Gate. \nThe Rosewood Hall has overlapping signal areas with Oakshade Library, Dragon’s Gate. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 25 major locations in the city: Azure Gardens, Lunar Pier, Lighthouse Point, Haven Docks, Nimbus Plaza, Quartz District, Mosaic Plaza, Flare Alley, Velvet Corner, Evergreen Circle, Flint Forge Quarter, Westgate Station, Dragon’s Gate, Oakshade Library, Union Square Market, Echo Station, Horizon Mall, Willowshade Pavilion, Primrose Boulevard, Sapphire Arena, Riverstone Wharf, Brass Lantern Tavern, Knight’s Market, Temple Square and Gilded Archway. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Azure Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier, Westgate Station, Oakshade Library, Willowshade Pavilion, Sapphire Arena. \nThe Lunar Pier has overlapping signal areas with Lighthouse Point, Haven Docks, Flare Alley, Flint Forge Quarter, Westgate Station, Horizon Mall, Willowshade Pavilion, Brass Lantern Tavern, Knight’s Market, Temple Square. \nThe Lighthouse Point has overlapping signal areas with Haven Docks, Nimbus Plaza, Flare Alley, Oakshade Library, Union Square Market, Sapphire Arena, Temple Square, Gilded Archway. \nThe Haven Docks has overlapping signal areas with Nimbus Plaza, Evergreen Circle, Flint Forge Quarter, Union Square Market, Willowshade Pavilion, Primrose Boulevard, Knight’s Market, Temple Square, Gilded Archway. \nThe Nimbus Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza, Evergreen Circle, Westgate Station, Dragon’s Gate, Oakshade Library, Willowshade Pavilion, Brass Lantern Tavern, Gilded Archway. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Flare Alley, Evergreen Circle, Oakshade Library, Horizon Mall, Willowshade Pavilion, Sapphire Arena, Knight’s Market. \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Velvet Corner, Westgate Station, Dragon’s Gate, Union Square Market, Primrose Boulevard, Brass Lantern Tavern, Knight’s Market. \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Evergreen Circle, Dragon’s Gate, Oakshade Library, Primrose Boulevard, Riverstone Wharf, Brass Lantern Tavern, Knight’s Market. \nThe Velvet Corner has overlapping signal areas with Evergreen Circle, Flint Forge Quarter, Echo Station, Horizon Mall, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Evergreen Circle has overlapping signal areas with Westgate Station, Dragon’s Gate, Oakshade Library, Union Square Market, Willowshade Pavilion, Primrose Boulevard, Sapphire Arena, Knight’s Market. \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Union Square Market, Echo Station, Willowshade Pavilion, Sapphire Arena, Riverstone Wharf, Knight’s Market, Temple Square, Gilded Archway. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Oakshade Library, Union Square Market, Horizon Mall, Sapphire Arena, Riverstone Wharf, Brass Lantern Tavern, Gilded Archway. \nThe Dragon’s Gate has overlapping signal areas with Oakshade Library, Union Square Market, Echo Station, Willowshade Pavilion, Primrose Boulevard, Riverstone Wharf, Brass Lantern Tavern, Gilded Archway. \nThe Oakshade Library has overlapping signal areas with Union Square Market, Horizon Mall, Primrose Boulevard, Sapphire Arena, Riverstone Wharf, Brass Lantern Tavern, Knight’s Market. \nThe Union Square Market has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station, Willowshade Pavilion, Brass Lantern Tavern, Knight’s Market, Gilded Archway. \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with Horizon Mall, Riverstone Wharf, Gilded Archway. \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Riverstone Wharf, Temple Square. \nThe Willowshade Pavilion has overlapping signal areas with Primrose Boulevard, Riverstone Wharf, Brass Lantern Tavern, Temple Square. \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena, Brass Lantern Tavern, Knight’s Market. \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway. \nThe Riverstone Wharf has overlapping signal areas with Knight’s Market. \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with Knight’s Market, Gilded Archway. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 25 major locations in the city: Quartz District, Quarry Point, Maplewood Conservatory, King’s Row, Umbra Theater, Opal Theater, Rosewood Hall, Temple Square, Sapphire Arena, Echo Station, Flare Alley, Velvet Corner, Knight’s Market, Duskwood Park, Evergreen Circle, Willowshade Pavilion, Copper Clock Square, Oakshade Library, Union Square Market, Northwind Tower, Moonlit Promenade, Haven Docks, Brass Lantern Tavern, Ironbridge Crossing and Riverstone Wharf. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Maplewood Conservatory, King’s Row, Opal Theater, Rosewood Hall, Sapphire Arena, Echo Station, Flare Alley, Evergreen Circle, Moonlit Promenade, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Quarry Point has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater, Velvet Corner, Duskwood Park, Evergreen Circle, Willowshade Pavilion, Oakshade Library, Union Square Market, Haven Docks, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Maplewood Conservatory has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Umbra Theater, Rosewood Hall, Echo Station, Flare Alley, Velvet Corner, Duskwood Park, Willowshade Pavilion, Oakshade Library, Moonlit Promenade, Brass Lantern Tavern, Ironbridge Crossing. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station, Evergreen Circle, Copper Clock Square, Union Square Market, Northwind Tower, Moonlit Promenade, Haven Docks. \nThe Umbra Theater has overlapping signal areas with Temple Square, Sapphire Arena, Flare Alley, Velvet Corner, Knight’s Market, Evergreen Circle, Copper Clock Square, Oakshade Library, Moonlit Promenade, Ironbridge Crossing. \nThe Opal Theater has overlapping signal areas with Temple Square, Sapphire Arena, Echo Station, Velvet Corner, Knight’s Market, Evergreen Circle, Brass Lantern Tavern, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Rosewood Hall has overlapping signal areas with Temple Square, Echo Station, Velvet Corner, Knight’s Market, Willowshade Pavilion, Copper Clock Square, Union Square Market, Moonlit Promenade, Ironbridge Crossing, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Temple Square has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station, Willowshade Pavilion, Copper Clock Square, Oakshade Library, Union Square Market, Moonlit Promenade, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with Evergreen Circle, Willowshade Pavilion, Copper Clock Square, Moonlit Promenade, Haven Docks, Brass Lantern Tavern, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with Flare Alley, Velvet Corner, Willowshade Pavilion, Moonlit Promenade, Brass Lantern Tavern, Ironbridge Crossing. \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Knight’s Market, Union Square Market, Moonlit Promenade, Brass Lantern Tavern, Ironbridge Crossing. \nThe Velvet Corner has overlapping signal areas with Evergreen Circle, Willowshade Pavilion, Copper Clock Square, Union Square Market, Ironbridge Crossing. \nThe Knight’s Market has overlapping signal areas with Copper Clock Square, Oakshade Library, Northwind Tower, Haven Docks, Ironbridge Crossing. \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Oakshade Library, Union Square Market, Ironbridge Crossing, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Evergreen Circle has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Union Square Market, Ironbridge Crossing. \nThe Willowshade Pavilion has overlapping signal areas with Copper Clock Square, Moonlit Promenade, Haven Docks, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Copper Clock Square has overlapping signal areas with Oakshade Library, Union Square Market, Moonlit Promenade, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Oakshade Library has overlapping signal areas with Haven Docks, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Union Square Market has overlapping signal areas with Moonlit Promenade, Ironbridge Crossing. \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with Moonlit Promenade, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Haven Docks has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Riverstone Wharf. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 25 major locations in the city: Quarry Point, Shadowbridge Arcade, Beacon Tower, Twilight Harbor, Sapphire Arena, Riverstone Wharf, Primrose Boulevard, Pennywhistle Arcade, Quartz District, Lighthouse Point, Skyline Gardens, Northwind Tower, Horizon Mall, Silvercrest Observatory, Rosewood Hall, Umbra Theater, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Brass Lantern Tavern, Temple Square, Mosaic Plaza, Cobalt Market, Duskwood Park, Union Square Market, Gilded Archway and Lunar Pier. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Quarry Point has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower, Riverstone Wharf, Pennywhistle Arcade, Lighthouse Point, Northwind Tower, Silvercrest Observatory, Rosewood Hall, Umbra Theater, Mosaic Plaza. \nThe Shadowbridge Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower, Riverstone Wharf, Pennywhistle Arcade, Quartz District, Lighthouse Point, Skyline Gardens, Horizon Mall, Silvercrest Observatory, Rosewood Hall, Cobalt Market, Duskwood Park, Gilded Archway, Lunar Pier. \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena, Riverstone Wharf, Lighthouse Point, Northwind Tower, Silvercrest Observatory, Temple Square, Mosaic Plaza, Cobalt Market, Duskwood Park, Union Square Market, Lunar Pier. \nThe Twilight Harbor has overlapping signal areas with Quartz District, Horizon Mall, Silvercrest Observatory, Rosewood Hall, Umbra Theater, Cobalt Market, Duskwood Park, Union Square Market. \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with Primrose Boulevard, Pennywhistle Arcade, Skyline Gardens, Horizon Mall, Rosewood Hall, Umbra Theater, Temple Square, Cobalt Market, Duskwood Park, Union Square Market, Gilded Archway. \nThe Riverstone Wharf has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade, Quartz District, Skyline Gardens, Northwind Tower, Silvercrest Observatory, Umbra Theater, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Cobalt Market, Union Square Market. \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade, Quartz District, Skyline Gardens, Horizon Mall, Temple Square, Gilded Archway, Lunar Pier. \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Lighthouse Point, Rosewood Hall, Umbra Theater, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Temple Square, Mosaic Plaza, Lunar Pier. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens, Rosewood Hall, Umbra Theater, Brass Lantern Tavern, Temple Square. \nThe Lighthouse Point has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater, Mosaic Plaza, Duskwood Park, Union Square Market, Gilded Archway. \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Horizon Mall, Umbra Theater, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Mosaic Plaza, Cobalt Market, Duskwood Park. \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral, Temple Square, Cobalt Market. \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory, Rosewood Hall, Umbra Theater, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Mosaic Plaza, Cobalt Market, Duskwood Park, Gilded Archway. \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Temple Square, Duskwood Park. \nThe Rosewood Hall has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater, Brass Lantern Tavern, Temple Square, Union Square Market, Lunar Pier. \nThe Umbra Theater has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza, Duskwood Park. \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with Temple Square, Duskwood Park, Union Square Market, Lunar Pier. \nThe Temple Square has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza, Duskwood Park, Lunar Pier. \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park, Gilded Archway, Lunar Pier. \nThe Cobalt Market has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park. \nThe Union Square Market has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway. \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 25 major locations in the city: Granite Plaza, Haven Docks, Gilded Archway, Shadowbridge Arcade, Zenith Arena, Riverstone Wharf, Knight’s Market, Azure Gardens, Amber Plaza, Evergreen Circle, Union Square Market, Jasper Marina, Twilight Harbor, Horizon Mall, Westgate Station, Flare Alley, Silvercrest Observatory, Moonlit Promenade, Yarrow Plaza, Pennywhistle Arcade, Skyline Gardens, Primrose Boulevard, Ironbridge Crossing, Lighthouse Point and Oakshade Library. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Haven Docks, Shadowbridge Arcade, Zenith Arena, Amber Plaza, Twilight Harbor, Silvercrest Observatory, Yarrow Plaza, Oakshade Library. \nThe Haven Docks has overlapping signal areas with Riverstone Wharf, Knight’s Market, Amber Plaza, Evergreen Circle, Union Square Market, Jasper Marina, Twilight Harbor, Flare Alley, Silvercrest Observatory, Pennywhistle Arcade, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Knight’s Market, Evergreen Circle, Twilight Harbor, Westgate Station, Moonlit Promenade, Yarrow Plaza, Skyline Gardens, Primrose Boulevard, Lighthouse Point. \nThe Shadowbridge Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Evergreen Circle, Horizon Mall, Skyline Gardens, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Zenith Arena has overlapping signal areas with Riverstone Wharf, Knight’s Market, Evergreen Circle, Union Square Market, Jasper Marina, Twilight Harbor, Horizon Mall, Silvercrest Observatory, Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Riverstone Wharf has overlapping signal areas with Knight’s Market, Amber Plaza, Union Square Market, Jasper Marina, Twilight Harbor, Horizon Mall, Westgate Station, Flare Alley, Moonlit Promenade, Pennywhistle Arcade, Skyline Gardens, Primrose Boulevard, Ironbridge Crossing, Oakshade Library. \nThe Knight’s Market has overlapping signal areas with Azure Gardens, Amber Plaza, Twilight Harbor, Horizon Mall, Westgate Station, Moonlit Promenade, Pennywhistle Arcade, Skyline Gardens. \nThe Azure Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Horizon Mall, Flare Alley, Pennywhistle Arcade, Skyline Gardens, Ironbridge Crossing. \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Evergreen Circle, Jasper Marina, Twilight Harbor, Silvercrest Observatory, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Evergreen Circle has overlapping signal areas with Twilight Harbor, Horizon Mall, Flare Alley, Moonlit Promenade, Yarrow Plaza. \nThe Union Square Market has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina, Twilight Harbor, Flare Alley, Silvercrest Observatory, Moonlit Promenade, Yarrow Plaza, Skyline Gardens, Lighthouse Point. \nThe Jasper Marina has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory, Moonlit Promenade, Yarrow Plaza, Skyline Gardens, Oakshade Library. \nThe Twilight Harbor has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory, Pennywhistle Arcade, Lighthouse Point. \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade, Skyline Gardens, Oakshade Library. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory, Yarrow Plaza, Skyline Gardens, Primrose Boulevard, Ironbridge Crossing. \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory, Pennywhistle Arcade, Skyline Gardens, Lighthouse Point, Oakshade Library. \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, Pennywhistle Arcade, Skyline Gardens, Lighthouse Point, Oakshade Library. \nThe Moonlit Promenade has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, Primrose Boulevard, Ironbridge Crossing, Lighthouse Point. \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade, Skyline Gardens, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Primrose Boulevard, Lighthouse Point. \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Oakshade Library. \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with Ironbridge Crossing, Lighthouse Point, Oakshade Library. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 25 major locations in the city: Ivory Spire Cathedral, Horizon Mall, Duskwood Park, Flare Alley, Umbra Theater, Opal Theater, Rosewood Hall, Flint Forge Quarter, Knight’s Market, Mosaic Plaza, Westgate Station, Brass Lantern Tavern, Azure Gardens, Quartz District, Ironbridge Crossing, Amber Plaza, Willowshade Pavilion, Temple Square, Haven Docks, Jade Fountain, Primrose Boulevard, Granite Plaza, Echo Station, Cobalt Market and Sapphire Arena. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Horizon Mall, Umbra Theater, Opal Theater, Rosewood Hall, Flint Forge Quarter, Knight’s Market, Brass Lantern Tavern, Azure Gardens, Quartz District, Jade Fountain, Primrose Boulevard, Echo Station. \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Flare Alley, Umbra Theater, Westgate Station, Quartz District, Ironbridge Crossing, Willowshade Pavilion, Temple Square, Haven Docks, Granite Plaza. \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Flare Alley, Umbra Theater, Azure Gardens, Primrose Boulevard, Echo Station, Sapphire Arena. \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Rosewood Hall, Flint Forge Quarter, Brass Lantern Tavern, Ironbridge Crossing, Amber Plaza, Willowshade Pavilion, Jade Fountain, Primrose Boulevard, Granite Plaza. \nThe Umbra Theater has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater, Rosewood Hall, Flint Forge Quarter, Knight’s Market, Mosaic Plaza, Westgate Station, Willowshade Pavilion, Temple Square, Cobalt Market. \nThe Opal Theater has overlapping signal areas with Westgate Station, Ironbridge Crossing, Willowshade Pavilion, Haven Docks, Primrose Boulevard, Granite Plaza, Cobalt Market. \nThe Rosewood Hall has overlapping signal areas with Flint Forge Quarter, Knight’s Market, Westgate Station, Brass Lantern Tavern, Azure Gardens, Willowshade Pavilion, Haven Docks, Jade Fountain, Granite Plaza. \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Knight’s Market, Brass Lantern Tavern, Azure Gardens, Quartz District, Amber Plaza, Temple Square, Jade Fountain, Echo Station. \nThe Knight’s Market has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Ironbridge Crossing, Willowshade Pavilion, Haven Docks, Jade Fountain, Granite Plaza, Cobalt Market, Sapphire Arena. \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Azure Gardens, Quartz District, Ironbridge Crossing, Amber Plaza, Granite Plaza, Sapphire Arena. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Azure Gardens, Quartz District, Amber Plaza, Haven Docks, Granite Plaza, Echo Station. \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with Amber Plaza, Jade Fountain, Granite Plaza, Echo Station, Sapphire Arena. \nThe Azure Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Ironbridge Crossing, Amber Plaza, Willowshade Pavilion, Granite Plaza, Echo Station. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Amber Plaza, Haven Docks. \nThe Ironbridge Crossing has overlapping signal areas with Amber Plaza, Temple Square, Haven Docks, Jade Fountain, Granite Plaza, Sapphire Arena. \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Temple Square, Jade Fountain, Sapphire Arena. \nThe Willowshade Pavilion has overlapping signal areas with Jade Fountain, Cobalt Market, Sapphire Arena. \nThe Temple Square has overlapping signal areas with Haven Docks, Granite Plaza, Cobalt Market. \nThe Haven Docks has overlapping signal areas with Jade Fountain, Granite Plaza, Echo Station, Cobalt Market. \nThe Jade Fountain has overlapping signal areas with Cobalt Market. \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza, Echo Station. \nThe Cobalt Market has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 25 major locations in the city: Jade Fountain, Rosewood Hall, Velvet Corner, Pennywhistle Arcade, Cobalt Market, Moonlit Promenade, Westgate Station, King’s Row, Copper Clock Square, Mosaic Plaza, Oakshade Library, Azure Gardens, Quartz District, Jasper Marina, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Lighthouse Point, Willowshade Pavilion, Beacon Tower, Knight’s Market, Yarrow Plaza, Nimbus Plaza, Sapphire Arena, Flint Forge Quarter, Gilded Archway and Riverstone Wharf. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Jade Fountain has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade, Westgate Station, Copper Clock Square, Mosaic Plaza, Oakshade Library, Jasper Marina, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Lighthouse Point, Willowshade Pavilion, Beacon Tower, Gilded Archway, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Rosewood Hall has overlapping signal areas with Velvet Corner, Oakshade Library, Quartz District, Jasper Marina, Lighthouse Point, Willowshade Pavilion, Knight’s Market, Sapphire Arena, Gilded Archway, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Velvet Corner has overlapping signal areas with Copper Clock Square, Willowshade Pavilion, Yarrow Plaza, Sapphire Arena. \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Moonlit Promenade, Westgate Station, King’s Row, Mosaic Plaza, Azure Gardens, Quartz District, Willowshade Pavilion, Beacon Tower, Sapphire Arena, Flint Forge Quarter, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Cobalt Market has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Mosaic Plaza, Jasper Marina, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Beacon Tower, Nimbus Plaza, Sapphire Arena, Flint Forge Quarter, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Moonlit Promenade has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Copper Clock Square, Oakshade Library, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Willowshade Pavilion, Yarrow Plaza, Sapphire Arena, Flint Forge Quarter. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Oakshade Library, Lighthouse Point, Beacon Tower, Yarrow Plaza, Nimbus Plaza, Flint Forge Quarter. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Oakshade Library, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Lighthouse Point, Willowshade Pavilion, Beacon Tower, Knight’s Market, Yarrow Plaza, Sapphire Arena. \nThe Copper Clock Square has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral, Willowshade Pavilion, Knight’s Market, Yarrow Plaza, Nimbus Plaza, Sapphire Arena, Flint Forge Quarter, Gilded Archway, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Oakshade Library, Azure Gardens, Lighthouse Point, Willowshade Pavilion, Beacon Tower, Knight’s Market, Gilded Archway, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Oakshade Library has overlapping signal areas with Azure Gardens, Lighthouse Point, Yarrow Plaza, Nimbus Plaza, Gilded Archway. \nThe Azure Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina, Yarrow Plaza, Gilded Archway. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Knight’s Market, Flint Forge Quarter, Gilded Archway. \nThe Jasper Marina has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral, Lighthouse Point, Willowshade Pavilion, Beacon Tower, Yarrow Plaza, Flint Forge Quarter, Gilded Archway. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower, Knight’s Market, Yarrow Plaza, Nimbus Plaza, Gilded Archway, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Lighthouse Point has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion. \nThe Willowshade Pavilion has overlapping signal areas with Knight’s Market, Sapphire Arena, Flint Forge Quarter. \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with Nimbus Plaza, Gilded Archway. \nThe Knight’s Market has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, Nimbus Plaza, Gilded Archway. \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Nimbus Plaza, Sapphire Arena, Flint Forge Quarter. \nThe Nimbus Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Riverstone Wharf. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 25 major locations in the city: Ironbridge Crossing, Cobalt Market, Nimbus Plaza, Primrose Boulevard, Dragon’s Gate, Echo Station, Zenith Arena, Silvercrest Observatory, Umbra Theater, Granite Plaza, Northwind Tower, Lighthouse Point, Sapphire Arena, Yarrow Plaza, Temple Square, Union Square Market, Westgate Station, Azure Gardens, Flint Forge Quarter, Rosewood Hall, Quarry Point, Knight’s Market, Flare Alley, Willowshade Pavilion and Moonlit Promenade. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Ironbridge Crossing has overlapping signal areas with Cobalt Market, Nimbus Plaza, Primrose Boulevard, Echo Station, Zenith Arena, Granite Plaza, Northwind Tower, Sapphire Arena, Yarrow Plaza, Temple Square, Union Square Market, Flare Alley, Willowshade Pavilion, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Cobalt Market has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station, Sapphire Arena, Flint Forge Quarter, Quarry Point, Knight’s Market. \nThe Nimbus Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Primrose Boulevard, Zenith Arena, Granite Plaza, Northwind Tower, Lighthouse Point, Yarrow Plaza, Westgate Station, Flare Alley. \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station, Silvercrest Observatory, Granite Plaza, Northwind Tower, Westgate Station, Flint Forge Quarter, Knight’s Market. \nThe Dragon’s Gate has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station, Granite Plaza, Lighthouse Point, Sapphire Arena, Union Square Market, Azure Gardens, Flint Forge Quarter, Rosewood Hall, Quarry Point, Flare Alley. \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory, Umbra Theater, Granite Plaza, Northwind Tower, Yarrow Plaza, Temple Square, Union Square Market, Flint Forge Quarter, Rosewood Hall, Knight’s Market, Willowshade Pavilion, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Zenith Arena has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory, Granite Plaza, Lighthouse Point, Temple Square, Union Square Market, Westgate Station, Azure Gardens, Rosewood Hall, Quarry Point. \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with Lighthouse Point, Union Square Market, Quarry Point, Knight’s Market, Willowshade Pavilion, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Umbra Theater has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza, Lighthouse Point, Sapphire Arena, Temple Square, Union Square Market, Westgate Station, Azure Gardens, Knight’s Market, Flare Alley. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, Sapphire Arena, Rosewood Hall, Knight’s Market, Flare Alley, Willowshade Pavilion. \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with Lighthouse Point, Sapphire Arena, Temple Square, Flint Forge Quarter, Rosewood Hall, Knight’s Market, Flare Alley. \nThe Lighthouse Point has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena, Yarrow Plaza, Temple Square, Knight’s Market, Willowshade Pavilion. \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, Westgate Station, Azure Gardens, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Temple Square, Union Square Market. \nThe Temple Square has overlapping signal areas with Union Square Market, Westgate Station, Quarry Point, Willowshade Pavilion. \nThe Union Square Market has overlapping signal areas with Westgate Station, Rosewood Hall, Quarry Point, Willowshade Pavilion. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Quarry Point, Knight’s Market, Flare Alley, Willowshade Pavilion. \nThe Azure Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Flare Alley, Willowshade Pavilion, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Quarry Point, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Quarry Point has overlapping signal areas with Flare Alley. \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Willowshade Pavilion has overlapping signal areas with Moonlit Promenade. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 25 major locations in the city: Quartz District, Sapphire Arena, Ironbridge Crossing, Willowshade Pavilion, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Westgate Station, Cobalt Market, Duskwood Park, Yarrow Plaza, Zenith Arena, Union Square Market, Jasper Marina, Copper Clock Square, Umbra Theater, Primrose Boulevard, Skyline Gardens, Echo Station, Flare Alley, Northwind Tower, Pennywhistle Arcade, Azure Gardens, Velvet Corner, Brass Lantern Tavern, Dragon’s Gate and Granite Plaza. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena, Ironbridge Crossing, Willowshade Pavilion, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Westgate Station, Yarrow Plaza, Zenith Arena, Union Square Market, Jasper Marina, Skyline Gardens, Echo Station, Flare Alley. \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with Cobalt Market, Union Square Market, Jasper Marina, Copper Clock Square, Flare Alley, Pennywhistle Arcade, Velvet Corner, Brass Lantern Tavern, Granite Plaza. \nThe Ironbridge Crossing has overlapping signal areas with Westgate Station, Yarrow Plaza, Zenith Arena, Union Square Market, Jasper Marina, Skyline Gardens, Flare Alley, Northwind Tower, Pennywhistle Arcade, Azure Gardens, Velvet Corner, Brass Lantern Tavern, Dragon’s Gate, Granite Plaza. \nThe Willowshade Pavilion has overlapping signal areas with Westgate Station, Cobalt Market, Yarrow Plaza, Zenith Arena, Jasper Marina, Umbra Theater, Primrose Boulevard, Echo Station, Northwind Tower, Pennywhistle Arcade, Velvet Corner, Brass Lantern Tavern, Dragon’s Gate. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Westgate Station, Cobalt Market, Umbra Theater, Primrose Boulevard, Velvet Corner, Brass Lantern Tavern, Dragon’s Gate. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park, Zenith Arena, Flare Alley, Pennywhistle Arcade, Dragon’s Gate. \nThe Cobalt Market has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park, Yarrow Plaza, Copper Clock Square, Velvet Corner, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, Zenith Arena, Union Square Market, Umbra Theater, Primrose Boulevard, Azure Gardens, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina, Copper Clock Square, Echo Station, Pennywhistle Arcade, Azure Gardens, Dragon’s Gate. \nThe Zenith Arena has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina, Skyline Gardens, Echo Station, Pennywhistle Arcade, Brass Lantern Tavern, Dragon’s Gate. \nThe Union Square Market has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina, Umbra Theater, Northwind Tower, Pennywhistle Arcade, Azure Gardens. \nThe Jasper Marina has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, Velvet Corner, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Copper Clock Square has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater, Echo Station, Flare Alley, Northwind Tower, Pennywhistle Arcade, Azure Gardens, Brass Lantern Tavern, Dragon’s Gate. \nThe Umbra Theater has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens, Velvet Corner, Granite Plaza. \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens, Flare Alley, Northwind Tower, Azure Gardens. \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station, Flare Alley, Northwind Tower, Pennywhistle Arcade, Azure Gardens, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with Flare Alley, Velvet Corner. \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade, Dragon’s Gate, Granite Plaza. \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with Velvet Corner, Granite Plaza. \nThe Azure Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Velvet Corner, Dragon’s Gate, Granite Plaza. \nThe Velvet Corner has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with Dragon’s Gate. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 25 major locations in the city: Twilight Harbor, Primrose Boulevard, Azure Gardens, Oakshade Library, Willowshade Pavilion, Lunar Pier, Rosewood Hall, Shadowbridge Arcade, Pennywhistle Arcade, Evergreen Circle, Union Square Market, Mosaic Plaza, Ironbridge Crossing, Duskwood Park, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Westgate Station, Flint Forge Quarter, Nimbus Plaza, Jade Fountain, Zenith Arena, Echo Station, Cobalt Market, Opal Theater, Horizon Mall and Silvercrest Observatory. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Twilight Harbor has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade, Mosaic Plaza, Duskwood Park, Flint Forge Quarter, Echo Station, Cobalt Market. \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with Azure Gardens, Oakshade Library, Willowshade Pavilion, Evergreen Circle, Union Square Market, Westgate Station, Flint Forge Quarter, Nimbus Plaza, Jade Fountain, Zenith Arena, Echo Station. \nThe Azure Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Pennywhistle Arcade, Evergreen Circle, Union Square Market, Ironbridge Crossing, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Jade Fountain, Opal Theater, Silvercrest Observatory. \nThe Oakshade Library has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Rosewood Hall, Shadowbridge Arcade, Evergreen Circle, Union Square Market, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Jade Fountain, Zenith Arena, Echo Station, Horizon Mall, Silvercrest Observatory. \nThe Willowshade Pavilion has overlapping signal areas with Union Square Market, Duskwood Park, Westgate Station, Nimbus Plaza, Jade Fountain, Zenith Arena, Cobalt Market, Horizon Mall, Silvercrest Observatory. \nThe Lunar Pier has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade, Pennywhistle Arcade, Duskwood Park, Westgate Station, Jade Fountain, Zenith Arena, Opal Theater, Horizon Mall. \nThe Rosewood Hall has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade, Evergreen Circle, Union Square Market, Mosaic Plaza, Flint Forge Quarter, Nimbus Plaza, Zenith Arena, Opal Theater, Horizon Mall. \nThe Shadowbridge Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade, Mosaic Plaza, Jade Fountain, Echo Station. \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Ironbridge Crossing, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Flint Forge Quarter, Nimbus Plaza, Zenith Arena, Echo Station, Opal Theater, Silvercrest Observatory. \nThe Evergreen Circle has overlapping signal areas with Ironbridge Crossing, Westgate Station, Flint Forge Quarter, Echo Station, Horizon Mall, Silvercrest Observatory. \nThe Union Square Market has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza, Ironbridge Crossing, Duskwood Park, Flint Forge Quarter, Zenith Arena. \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Ironbridge Crossing, Duskwood Park, Echo Station, Cobalt Market, Opal Theater. \nThe Ironbridge Crossing has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Westgate Station, Jade Fountain, Zenith Arena, Echo Station, Cobalt Market, Opal Theater, Horizon Mall. \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Jade Fountain, Zenith Arena, Opal Theater, Silvercrest Observatory. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Westgate Station, Flint Forge Quarter, Nimbus Plaza, Zenith Arena, Echo Station, Horizon Mall. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Flint Forge Quarter, Zenith Arena, Cobalt Market, Horizon Mall. \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Nimbus Plaza, Echo Station, Cobalt Market. \nThe Nimbus Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Jade Fountain. \nThe Jade Fountain has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station, Horizon Mall, Silvercrest Observatory. \nThe Zenith Arena has overlapping signal areas with Cobalt Market, Opal Theater. \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with Horizon Mall, Silvercrest Observatory. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 25 major locations in the city: Gilded Archway, Primrose Boulevard, Cobalt Market, Amber Plaza, Echo Station, Pennywhistle Arcade, Ironbridge Crossing, Mosaic Plaza, Temple Square, Twilight Harbor, Granite Plaza, Beacon Tower, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Lighthouse Point, Opal Theater, Sapphire Arena, Zenith Arena, Jasper Marina, Shadowbridge Arcade, Horizon Mall, Silvercrest Observatory, Lunar Pier, Copper Clock Square, Velvet Corner and Moonlit Promenade. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station, Ironbridge Crossing, Twilight Harbor, Beacon Tower, Opal Theater, Zenith Arena, Horizon Mall, Lunar Pier, Copper Clock Square, Velvet Corner. \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with Amber Plaza, Ironbridge Crossing, Temple Square, Granite Plaza, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Sapphire Arena, Silvercrest Observatory, Lunar Pier, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Cobalt Market has overlapping signal areas with Amber Plaza, Pennywhistle Arcade, Ironbridge Crossing, Granite Plaza, Beacon Tower, Zenith Arena, Horizon Mall, Lunar Pier, Velvet Corner. \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station, Ironbridge Crossing, Twilight Harbor, Lighthouse Point, Opal Theater, Sapphire Arena, Jasper Marina, Horizon Mall, Silvercrest Observatory, Copper Clock Square, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with Ironbridge Crossing, Mosaic Plaza, Temple Square, Granite Plaza, Sapphire Arena, Lunar Pier, Velvet Corner, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Ironbridge Crossing, Mosaic Plaza, Beacon Tower, Zenith Arena, Horizon Mall, Silvercrest Observatory, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Ironbridge Crossing has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza, Jasper Marina, Horizon Mall, Lunar Pier, Copper Clock Square, Velvet Corner, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Temple Square, Twilight Harbor, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Copper Clock Square, Velvet Corner, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Temple Square has overlapping signal areas with Twilight Harbor, Granite Plaza, Beacon Tower, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Lighthouse Point, Zenith Arena, Shadowbridge Arcade, Horizon Mall. \nThe Twilight Harbor has overlapping signal areas with Lighthouse Point, Zenith Arena, Jasper Marina, Shadowbridge Arcade, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral, Zenith Arena, Silvercrest Observatory, Velvet Corner, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral, Sapphire Arena. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Lighthouse Point, Opal Theater, Sapphire Arena, Shadowbridge Arcade, Horizon Mall, Lunar Pier. \nThe Lighthouse Point has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena, Shadowbridge Arcade, Silvercrest Observatory, Lunar Pier, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Opal Theater has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena, Jasper Marina, Shadowbridge Arcade. \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with Zenith Arena, Jasper Marina, Shadowbridge Arcade, Horizon Mall, Silvercrest Observatory, Lunar Pier, Velvet Corner. \nThe Zenith Arena has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina, Silvercrest Observatory, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Jasper Marina has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade, Horizon Mall, Copper Clock Square, Velvet Corner, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Shadowbridge Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory, Copper Clock Square, Velvet Corner. \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier. \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with Velvet Corner, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Copper Clock Square has overlapping signal areas with Velvet Corner, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Velvet Corner has overlapping signal areas with Moonlit Promenade. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

The network will cover 25 major locations in the city: Velvet Corner, Rosewood Hall, Pennywhistle Arcade, Gilded Archway, Quarry Point, Shadowbridge Arcade, Moonlit Promenade, Haven Docks, King’s Row, Umbra Theater, Skyline Gardens, Mosaic Plaza, Dragon’s Gate, Copper Clock Square, Maplewood Conservatory, Echo Station, Willowshade Pavilion, Yarrow Plaza, Knight’s Market, Sapphire Arena, Union Square Market, Nimbus Plaza, Azure Gardens, Granite Plaza and Opal Theater. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Velvet Corner has overlapping signal areas with Quarry Point, Shadowbridge Arcade, Haven Docks, Umbra Theater, Skyline Gardens, Willowshade Pavilion, Nimbus Plaza. \nThe Rosewood Hall has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway, Shadowbridge Arcade, Moonlit Promenade, Umbra Theater, Skyline Gardens, Copper Clock Square, Maplewood Conservatory, Echo Station, Yarrow Plaza, Knight’s Market, Sapphire Arena, Azure Gardens, Opal Theater. \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway, Haven Docks, Umbra Theater, Skyline Gardens, Mosaic Plaza, Dragon’s Gate, Maplewood Conservatory, Echo Station, Willowshade Pavilion, Union Square Market, Azure Gardens. \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade, Moonlit Promenade, Haven Docks, Skyline Gardens, Mosaic Plaza, Dragon’s Gate, Copper Clock Square, Maplewood Conservatory, Echo Station, Knight’s Market, Sapphire Arena, Azure Gardens, Granite Plaza. \nThe Quarry Point has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade, King’s Row, Umbra Theater, Skyline Gardens, Copper Clock Square, Nimbus Plaza, Azure Gardens, Granite Plaza. \nThe Shadowbridge Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater, Mosaic Plaza, Copper Clock Square, Willowshade Pavilion, Knight’s Market, Union Square Market, Azure Gardens. \nThe Moonlit Promenade has overlapping signal areas with Haven Docks, Umbra Theater, Skyline Gardens, Mosaic Plaza, Willowshade Pavilion, Sapphire Arena, Opal Theater. \nThe Haven Docks has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Mosaic Plaza, Dragon’s Gate, Copper Clock Square, Maplewood Conservatory, Echo Station, Union Square Market. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater, Mosaic Plaza, Copper Clock Square, Maplewood Conservatory, Willowshade Pavilion, Yarrow Plaza, Knight’s Market. \nThe Umbra Theater has overlapping signal areas with Copper Clock Square, Willowshade Pavilion, Yarrow Plaza, Sapphire Arena, Union Square Market, Nimbus Plaza, Opal Theater. \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza, Maplewood Conservatory, Yarrow Plaza, Union Square Market, Nimbus Plaza, Granite Plaza. \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Copper Clock Square, Willowshade Pavilion, Sapphire Arena, Nimbus Plaza. \nThe Dragon’s Gate has overlapping signal areas with Copper Clock Square, Maplewood Conservatory, Echo Station, Yarrow Plaza, Sapphire Arena, Azure Gardens, Granite Plaza, Opal Theater. \nThe Copper Clock Square has overlapping signal areas with Knight’s Market, Granite Plaza. \nThe Maplewood Conservatory has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Union Square Market. \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Yarrow Plaza, Azure Gardens. \nThe Willowshade Pavilion has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, Azure Gardens. \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Knight’s Market, Union Square Market, Azure Gardens. \nThe Knight’s Market has overlapping signal areas with Azure Gardens, Granite Plaza, Opal Theater. \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with Nimbus Plaza, Granite Plaza. \nThe Union Square Market has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater. \nThe Nimbus Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza. \nThe Azure Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Temple Square has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens, Velvet Corner, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Jasper Marina, Zenith Arena, Flint Forge Quarter, Northwind Tower, Westgate Station, Azure Gardens. \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway, Skyline Gardens, Pennywhistle Arcade, Jasper Marina, Twilight Harbor, Zenith Arena, Dragon’s Gate, Evergreen Circle, Westgate Station, Quartz District, Azure Gardens, King’s Row. \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens, Velvet Corner, Twilight Harbor, Brass Lantern Tavern, Riverstone Wharf, Evergreen Circle, Northwind Tower, King’s Row. \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Jade Fountain, Copper Clock Square, Pennywhistle Arcade, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Jasper Marina, Twilight Harbor, Cobalt Market, Brass Lantern Tavern, Zenith Arena, Nimbus Plaza, Dragon’s Gate, Flint Forge Quarter, Evergreen Circle, King’s Row. \nThe Jade Fountain has overlapping signal areas with Twilight Harbor, Brass Lantern Tavern, Zenith Arena, Nimbus Plaza, Flint Forge Quarter, Evergreen Circle, Quartz District, Azure Gardens, King’s Row. \nThe Velvet Corner has overlapping signal areas with Cobalt Market, Brass Lantern Tavern, Quartz District, Azure Gardens, King’s Row. \nThe Copper Clock Square has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina, Cobalt Market, Northwind Tower, Quartz District, Azure Gardens. \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina, Twilight Harbor, Riverstone Wharf, Nimbus Plaza, Opal Theater, Flint Forge Quarter. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina, Cobalt Market, Opal Theater, Evergreen Circle, Westgate Station. \nThe Jasper Marina has overlapping signal areas with Nimbus Plaza, Dragon’s Gate, Opal Theater, Quartz District, King’s Row. \nThe Twilight Harbor has overlapping signal areas with Cobalt Market, Brass Lantern Tavern, Zenith Arena, Riverstone Wharf, Flint Forge Quarter, Evergreen Circle, Northwind Tower, Quartz District. \nThe Cobalt Market has overlapping signal areas with Nimbus Plaza, Evergreen Circle, Northwind Tower, Quartz District. \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with Zenith Arena, Riverstone Wharf, Nimbus Plaza, Dragon’s Gate, Opal Theater, Quartz District, King’s Row. \nThe Zenith Arena has overlapping signal areas with Nimbus Plaza, Dragon’s Gate, Northwind Tower, King’s Row. \nThe Riverstone Wharf has overlapping signal areas with Nimbus Plaza, Northwind Tower, Quartz District, Azure Gardens, King’s Row. \nThe Nimbus Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater, Flint Forge Quarter, Westgate Station. \nThe Dragon’s Gate has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater, Flint Forge Quarter, Evergreen Circle, Northwind Tower, Westgate Station, Azure Gardens. \nThe Opal Theater has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, Azure Gardens. \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Westgate Station, Azure Gardens. \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with Quartz District, Azure Gardens. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Quartz District, King’s Row. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Azure Gardens. \nThe Azure Gardens has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 25 major locations in the city: Horizon Mall, Amber Plaza, Duskwood Park, Cobalt Market, Knight’s Market, King’s Row, Skyline Gardens, Zenith Arena, Sapphire Arena, Opal Theater, Beacon Tower, Azure Gardens, Quarry Point, Gilded Archway, Temple Square, Westgate Station, Silvercrest Observatory, Velvet Corner, Copper Clock Square, Primrose Boulevard, Rosewood Hall, Riverstone Wharf, Granite Plaza, Willowshade Pavilion and Echo Station. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Cobalt Market, King’s Row, Skyline Gardens, Azure Gardens, Quarry Point, Gilded Archway, Velvet Corner, Copper Clock Square, Primrose Boulevard, Rosewood Hall, Granite Plaza, Willowshade Pavilion, Echo Station. \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park, Skyline Gardens, Opal Theater, Westgate Station, Silvercrest Observatory, Velvet Corner, Granite Plaza. \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Cobalt Market, Knight’s Market, King’s Row, Skyline Gardens, Opal Theater, Gilded Archway, Rosewood Hall, Riverstone Wharf, Willowshade Pavilion. \nThe Cobalt Market has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena, Opal Theater, Azure Gardens, Gilded Archway, Temple Square, Silvercrest Observatory, Riverstone Wharf, Willowshade Pavilion, Echo Station. \nThe Knight’s Market has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower, Quarry Point, Westgate Station, Primrose Boulevard, Granite Plaza, Willowshade Pavilion. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens, Zenith Arena, Opal Theater, Azure Gardens, Quarry Point, Westgate Station, Primrose Boulevard, Willowshade Pavilion. \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Zenith Arena, Sapphire Arena, Opal Theater, Silvercrest Observatory, Rosewood Hall. \nThe Zenith Arena has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower, Quarry Point, Silvercrest Observatory, Velvet Corner, Primrose Boulevard, Echo Station. \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with Azure Gardens, Temple Square, Westgate Station, Silvercrest Observatory, Velvet Corner, Copper Clock Square, Primrose Boulevard, Riverstone Wharf, Granite Plaza. \nThe Opal Theater has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower, Quarry Point, Gilded Archway, Temple Square, Westgate Station. \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway, Temple Square, Westgate Station, Silvercrest Observatory, Velvet Corner, Rosewood Hall, Echo Station. \nThe Azure Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Quarry Point, Gilded Archway, Copper Clock Square, Rosewood Hall, Riverstone Wharf, Granite Plaza, Willowshade Pavilion, Echo Station. \nThe Quarry Point has overlapping signal areas with Westgate Station, Velvet Corner, Copper Clock Square, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Westgate Station, Copper Clock Square, Primrose Boulevard, Rosewood Hall, Riverstone Wharf, Granite Plaza, Willowshade Pavilion, Echo Station. \nThe Temple Square has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory, Riverstone Wharf, Granite Plaza. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Copper Clock Square, Riverstone Wharf, Granite Plaza, Willowshade Pavilion, Echo Station. \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with Copper Clock Square, Riverstone Wharf, Granite Plaza, Willowshade Pavilion. \nThe Velvet Corner has overlapping signal areas with Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Copper Clock Square has overlapping signal areas with Primrose Boulevard, Rosewood Hall, Granite Plaza. \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with Rosewood Hall. \nThe Rosewood Hall has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Echo Station. \nThe Riverstone Wharf has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Echo Station. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 25 major locations in the city: Flint Forge Quarter, Jasper Marina, Mosaic Plaza, Pennywhistle Arcade, Yarrow Plaza, King’s Row, Brass Lantern Tavern, Quartz District, Skyline Gardens, Westgate Station, Willowshade Pavilion, Riverstone Wharf, Rosewood Hall, Lighthouse Point, Maplewood Conservatory, Nimbus Plaza, Sapphire Arena, Flare Alley, Shadowbridge Arcade, Ironbridge Crossing, Velvet Corner, Beacon Tower, Opal Theater, Lunar Pier and Knight’s Market. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina, Skyline Gardens, Maplewood Conservatory, Flare Alley, Lunar Pier, Knight’s Market. \nThe Jasper Marina has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza, Yarrow Plaza, King’s Row, Westgate Station, Riverstone Wharf, Lighthouse Point, Maplewood Conservatory, Flare Alley, Shadowbridge Arcade, Ironbridge Crossing, Lunar Pier. \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade, Skyline Gardens, Westgate Station, Rosewood Hall, Lighthouse Point, Sapphire Arena, Ironbridge Crossing, Opal Theater. \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Quartz District, Riverstone Wharf, Lighthouse Point, Flare Alley, Shadowbridge Arcade, Ironbridge Crossing, Beacon Tower, Lunar Pier, Knight’s Market. \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Westgate Station, Riverstone Wharf, Sapphire Arena, Ironbridge Crossing, Velvet Corner, Opal Theater, Knight’s Market. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Westgate Station, Willowshade Pavilion, Lighthouse Point, Sapphire Arena, Flare Alley, Shadowbridge Arcade, Ironbridge Crossing, Opal Theater, Lunar Pier. \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens, Willowshade Pavilion, Riverstone Wharf, Flare Alley, Ironbridge Crossing, Velvet Corner. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens, Willowshade Pavilion, Maplewood Conservatory, Nimbus Plaza, Shadowbridge Arcade, Velvet Corner, Lunar Pier, Knight’s Market. \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Riverstone Wharf, Lighthouse Point, Nimbus Plaza, Sapphire Arena, Ironbridge Crossing, Beacon Tower, Opal Theater. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Rosewood Hall, Sapphire Arena, Flare Alley, Velvet Corner, Lunar Pier, Knight’s Market. \nThe Willowshade Pavilion has overlapping signal areas with Riverstone Wharf, Lighthouse Point, Maplewood Conservatory, Flare Alley, Ironbridge Crossing, Velvet Corner, Knight’s Market. \nThe Riverstone Wharf has overlapping signal areas with Rosewood Hall, Maplewood Conservatory, Ironbridge Crossing, Velvet Corner, Lunar Pier, Knight’s Market. \nThe Rosewood Hall has overlapping signal areas with Nimbus Plaza, Flare Alley, Ironbridge Crossing, Velvet Corner, Beacon Tower, Opal Theater, Lunar Pier. \nThe Lighthouse Point has overlapping signal areas with Flare Alley, Ironbridge Crossing, Opal Theater, Lunar Pier, Knight’s Market. \nThe Maplewood Conservatory has overlapping signal areas with Ironbridge Crossing, Beacon Tower, Lunar Pier. \nThe Nimbus Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Flare Alley, Ironbridge Crossing. \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower, Opal Theater, Knight’s Market. \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade, Ironbridge Crossing, Opal Theater, Knight’s Market. \nThe Ironbridge Crossing has overlapping signal areas with Velvet Corner, Lunar Pier. \nThe Velvet Corner has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater, Knight’s Market. \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater, Lunar Pier. \nThe Opal Theater has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 25 major locations in the city: Jade Fountain, Haven Docks, Gilded Archway, Pennywhistle Arcade, Duskwood Park, Willowshade Pavilion, Yarrow Plaza, Zenith Arena, Temple Square, Velvet Corner, Moonlit Promenade, Northwind Tower, Rosewood Hall, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Quarry Point, Copper Clock Square, Echo Station, Sapphire Arena, Silvercrest Observatory, Shadowbridge Arcade, Jasper Marina, Union Square Market, Flare Alley, Knight’s Market and Oakshade Library. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Jade Fountain has overlapping signal areas with Haven Docks, Willowshade Pavilion, Yarrow Plaza, Northwind Tower, Quarry Point, Copper Clock Square, Sapphire Arena, Silvercrest Observatory, Jasper Marina, Knight’s Market. \nThe Haven Docks has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade, Willowshade Pavilion, Yarrow Plaza, Quarry Point, Copper Clock Square, Silvercrest Observatory, Shadowbridge Arcade, Jasper Marina, Flare Alley, Oakshade Library. \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park, Willowshade Pavilion, Zenith Arena, Velvet Corner, Moonlit Promenade, Quarry Point, Copper Clock Square, Echo Station, Silvercrest Observatory, Jasper Marina, Union Square Market, Oakshade Library. \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park, Temple Square, Velvet Corner, Moonlit Promenade, Copper Clock Square, Echo Station, Sapphire Arena, Shadowbridge Arcade, Jasper Marina, Union Square Market, Oakshade Library. \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Zenith Arena, Temple Square, Velvet Corner, Sapphire Arena, Silvercrest Observatory, Shadowbridge Arcade, Union Square Market, Knight’s Market. \nThe Willowshade Pavilion has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, Velvet Corner, Moonlit Promenade, Rosewood Hall, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Quarry Point, Silvercrest Observatory, Jasper Marina, Flare Alley. \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Velvet Corner, Moonlit Promenade, Echo Station, Silvercrest Observatory, Jasper Marina, Union Square Market, Knight’s Market. \nThe Zenith Arena has overlapping signal areas with Velvet Corner, Moonlit Promenade, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Echo Station, Silvercrest Observatory, Shadowbridge Arcade, Jasper Marina, Knight’s Market. \nThe Temple Square has overlapping signal areas with Velvet Corner, Moonlit Promenade, Northwind Tower, Rosewood Hall, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Sapphire Arena, Jasper Marina, Flare Alley. \nThe Velvet Corner has overlapping signal areas with Moonlit Promenade, Rosewood Hall, Silvercrest Observatory, Jasper Marina, Flare Alley, Knight’s Market. \nThe Moonlit Promenade has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, Silvercrest Observatory, Jasper Marina, Union Square Market. \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with Quarry Point, Copper Clock Square, Echo Station, Silvercrest Observatory, Shadowbridge Arcade, Flare Alley. \nThe Rosewood Hall has overlapping signal areas with Quarry Point, Echo Station, Sapphire Arena, Shadowbridge Arcade, Jasper Marina, Oakshade Library. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Copper Clock Square, Flare Alley, Oakshade Library. \nThe Quarry Point has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory, Shadowbridge Arcade, Union Square Market. \nThe Copper Clock Square has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade, Union Square Market, Flare Alley, Knight’s Market, Oakshade Library. \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade. \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory, Union Square Market, Oakshade Library. \nThe Shadowbridge Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Union Square Market, Knight’s Market. \nThe Jasper Marina has overlapping signal areas with Union Square Market, Flare Alley. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 25 major locations in the city: King’s Row, Willowshade Pavilion, Silvercrest Observatory, Opal Theater, Skyline Gardens, Granite Plaza, Moonlit Promenade, Yarrow Plaza, Amber Plaza, Cobalt Market, Nimbus Plaza, Echo Station, Gilded Archway, Mosaic Plaza, Shadowbridge Arcade, Velvet Corner, Pennywhistle Arcade, Umbra Theater, Zenith Arena, Jasper Marina, Riverstone Wharf, Twilight Harbor, Knight’s Market, Beacon Tower and Flint Forge Quarter. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens, Granite Plaza, Moonlit Promenade, Yarrow Plaza, Cobalt Market, Echo Station, Shadowbridge Arcade, Pennywhistle Arcade, Umbra Theater, Zenith Arena, Beacon Tower. \nThe Willowshade Pavilion has overlapping signal areas with Amber Plaza, Nimbus Plaza, Echo Station, Gilded Archway, Mosaic Plaza, Shadowbridge Arcade, Velvet Corner, Umbra Theater, Zenith Arena, Riverstone Wharf, Twilight Harbor, Beacon Tower. \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater, Granite Plaza, Cobalt Market, Nimbus Plaza, Shadowbridge Arcade, Velvet Corner, Jasper Marina, Beacon Tower, Flint Forge Quarter. \nThe Opal Theater has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza, Moonlit Promenade, Yarrow Plaza, Amber Plaza, Nimbus Plaza, Shadowbridge Arcade, Umbra Theater, Zenith Arena, Riverstone Wharf, Twilight Harbor, Beacon Tower. \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Moonlit Promenade, Cobalt Market, Echo Station, Gilded Archway, Velvet Corner, Zenith Arena, Twilight Harbor, Beacon Tower, Flint Forge Quarter. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Amber Plaza, Cobalt Market, Echo Station, Shadowbridge Arcade, Pennywhistle Arcade, Umbra Theater, Riverstone Wharf, Twilight Harbor, Knight’s Market, Beacon Tower, Flint Forge Quarter. \nThe Moonlit Promenade has overlapping signal areas with Nimbus Plaza, Velvet Corner, Umbra Theater. \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Amber Plaza, Jasper Marina, Beacon Tower. \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Cobalt Market, Gilded Archway, Shadowbridge Arcade, Umbra Theater, Twilight Harbor, Flint Forge Quarter. \nThe Cobalt Market has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station, Umbra Theater, Jasper Marina, Twilight Harbor, Knight’s Market. \nThe Nimbus Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade, Zenith Arena, Jasper Marina, Twilight Harbor, Beacon Tower. \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza, Shadowbridge Arcade, Velvet Corner, Umbra Theater, Jasper Marina, Twilight Harbor, Knight’s Market, Beacon Tower, Flint Forge Quarter. \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Velvet Corner, Pennywhistle Arcade, Jasper Marina, Knight’s Market, Beacon Tower, Flint Forge Quarter. \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade, Jasper Marina, Knight’s Market, Beacon Tower. \nThe Shadowbridge Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade, Umbra Theater, Zenith Arena, Jasper Marina, Riverstone Wharf, Knight’s Market, Beacon Tower. \nThe Velvet Corner has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina, Riverstone Wharf, Twilight Harbor. \nThe Umbra Theater has overlapping signal areas with Zenith Arena, Jasper Marina, Knight’s Market. \nThe Zenith Arena has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina, Riverstone Wharf, Beacon Tower. \nThe Jasper Marina has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower. \nThe Riverstone Wharf has overlapping signal areas with Knight’s Market. \nThe Twilight Harbor has overlapping signal areas with Knight’s Market. \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with Flint Forge Quarter. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 25 major locations in the city: King’s Row, Velvet Corner, Willowshade Pavilion, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Dragon’s Gate, Mosaic Plaza, Sapphire Arena, Beacon Tower, Ironbridge Crossing, Rosewood Hall, Union Square Market, Knight’s Market, Gilded Archway, Oakshade Library, Jasper Marina, Horizon Mall, Azure Gardens, Copper Clock Square, Brass Lantern Tavern, Amber Plaza, Cobalt Market, Maplewood Conservatory, Nimbus Plaza, Quartz District and Duskwood Park. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Ironbridge Crossing, Rosewood Hall, Knight’s Market, Oakshade Library, Cobalt Market, Nimbus Plaza. \nThe Velvet Corner has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral, Dragon’s Gate, Mosaic Plaza, Rosewood Hall, Azure Gardens, Brass Lantern Tavern, Amber Plaza, Quartz District, Duskwood Park. \nThe Willowshade Pavilion has overlapping signal areas with Dragon’s Gate, Mosaic Plaza, Sapphire Arena, Ironbridge Crossing, Rosewood Hall, Knight’s Market, Amber Plaza, Cobalt Market, Duskwood Park. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza, Rosewood Hall, Union Square Market, Oakshade Library, Copper Clock Square, Amber Plaza, Cobalt Market, Quartz District. \nThe Dragon’s Gate has overlapping signal areas with Ironbridge Crossing, Union Square Market, Azure Gardens, Copper Clock Square, Brass Lantern Tavern, Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena, Beacon Tower, Ironbridge Crossing, Rosewood Hall, Union Square Market, Jasper Marina, Azure Gardens, Maplewood Conservatory, Quartz District. \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower, Ironbridge Crossing, Rosewood Hall, Knight’s Market, Gilded Archway, Copper Clock Square, Brass Lantern Tavern, Amber Plaza, Nimbus Plaza, Quartz District. \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with Rosewood Hall, Union Square Market, Knight’s Market, Gilded Archway, Oakshade Library, Azure Gardens, Cobalt Market, Nimbus Plaza. \nThe Ironbridge Crossing has overlapping signal areas with Union Square Market, Gilded Archway, Oakshade Library, Jasper Marina, Horizon Mall, Azure Gardens, Copper Clock Square, Brass Lantern Tavern, Maplewood Conservatory, Nimbus Plaza. \nThe Rosewood Hall has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina, Horizon Mall, Azure Gardens, Brass Lantern Tavern, Amber Plaza, Maplewood Conservatory, Duskwood Park. \nThe Union Square Market has overlapping signal areas with Knight’s Market, Oakshade Library, Jasper Marina, Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Knight’s Market has overlapping signal areas with Azure Gardens, Brass Lantern Tavern, Amber Plaza, Nimbus Plaza, Quartz District, Duskwood Park. \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Amber Plaza, Nimbus Plaza. \nThe Oakshade Library has overlapping signal areas with Azure Gardens, Brass Lantern Tavern, Amber Plaza, Quartz District, Duskwood Park. \nThe Jasper Marina has overlapping signal areas with Horizon Mall, Copper Clock Square, Brass Lantern Tavern, Amber Plaza, Cobalt Market, Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Azure Gardens, Cobalt Market, Maplewood Conservatory, Duskwood Park. \nThe Azure Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Nimbus Plaza, Duskwood Park. \nThe Copper Clock Square has overlapping signal areas with Amber Plaza, Cobalt Market. \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with Amber Plaza, Quartz District, Duskwood Park. \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Maplewood Conservatory, Nimbus Plaza, Duskwood Park. \nThe Cobalt Market has overlapping signal areas with Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Maplewood Conservatory has overlapping signal areas with Nimbus Plaza, Duskwood Park. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 25 major locations in the city: Amber Plaza, Jade Fountain, Twilight Harbor, Northwind Tower, Brass Lantern Tavern, Horizon Mall, Oakshade Library, Primrose Boulevard, Flint Forge Quarter, Westgate Station, Echo Station, Ironbridge Crossing, Mosaic Plaza, Lighthouse Point, Quarry Point, Dragon’s Gate, Jasper Marina, Flare Alley, Zenith Arena, Skyline Gardens, Azure Gardens, Knight’s Market, Temple Square, Beacon Tower and Copper Clock Square. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, Brass Lantern Tavern, Horizon Mall, Westgate Station, Echo Station, Ironbridge Crossing, Quarry Point, Jasper Marina, Zenith Arena, Skyline Gardens, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Jade Fountain has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, Horizon Mall, Primrose Boulevard, Echo Station, Lighthouse Point, Jasper Marina, Flare Alley, Zenith Arena. \nThe Twilight Harbor has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, Oakshade Library, Quarry Point, Jasper Marina, Temple Square, Beacon Tower, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with Horizon Mall, Echo Station, Mosaic Plaza, Jasper Marina, Skyline Gardens, Knight’s Market, Beacon Tower, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with Horizon Mall, Oakshade Library, Westgate Station, Ironbridge Crossing, Mosaic Plaza, Quarry Point, Dragon’s Gate, Zenith Arena, Skyline Gardens, Azure Gardens. \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Oakshade Library, Primrose Boulevard, Westgate Station, Ironbridge Crossing, Quarry Point, Dragon’s Gate, Flare Alley, Skyline Gardens, Azure Gardens, Beacon Tower. \nThe Oakshade Library has overlapping signal areas with Primrose Boulevard, Mosaic Plaza, Lighthouse Point, Flare Alley, Zenith Arena, Skyline Gardens, Azure Gardens, Temple Square, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with Ironbridge Crossing, Lighthouse Point, Quarry Point, Flare Alley, Zenith Arena, Azure Gardens, Knight’s Market, Temple Square, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Ironbridge Crossing, Zenith Arena. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Lighthouse Point, Flare Alley, Zenith Arena, Skyline Gardens, Azure Gardens, Knight’s Market, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza, Lighthouse Point, Quarry Point, Dragon’s Gate, Jasper Marina, Zenith Arena, Azure Gardens, Knight’s Market, Temple Square, Beacon Tower, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Ironbridge Crossing has overlapping signal areas with Azure Gardens, Temple Square, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina, Flare Alley, Zenith Arena, Skyline Gardens, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Lighthouse Point has overlapping signal areas with Dragon’s Gate, Jasper Marina, Flare Alley, Temple Square. \nThe Quarry Point has overlapping signal areas with Dragon’s Gate, Jasper Marina, Zenith Arena, Azure Gardens, Beacon Tower. \nThe Dragon’s Gate has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina, Skyline Gardens, Knight’s Market, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Jasper Marina has overlapping signal areas with Azure Gardens, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens, Azure Gardens, Knight’s Market, Beacon Tower. \nThe Zenith Arena has overlapping signal areas with Azure Gardens, Beacon Tower, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Knight’s Market. \nThe Azure Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Temple Square. \nThe Temple Square has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 25 major locations in the city: Flint Forge Quarter, Mosaic Plaza, Temple Square, Evergreen Circle, Umbra Theater, Rosewood Hall, Gilded Archway, Duskwood Park, Quartz District, Knight’s Market, Azure Gardens, Maplewood Conservatory, Beacon Tower, Willowshade Pavilion, King’s Row, Shadowbridge Arcade, Opal Theater, Yarrow Plaza, Horizon Mall, Zenith Arena, Jasper Marina, Velvet Corner, Brass Lantern Tavern, Echo Station and Skyline Gardens. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza, Evergreen Circle, Duskwood Park, Quartz District, Knight’s Market, Azure Gardens, Maplewood Conservatory, Yarrow Plaza, Skyline Gardens. \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater, Duskwood Park, Maplewood Conservatory, Beacon Tower, King’s Row, Opal Theater, Yarrow Plaza, Zenith Arena, Jasper Marina, Skyline Gardens. \nThe Temple Square has overlapping signal areas with Evergreen Circle, Umbra Theater, Rosewood Hall, Gilded Archway, Knight’s Market, Azure Gardens, Maplewood Conservatory, Shadowbridge Arcade, Horizon Mall, Zenith Arena, Jasper Marina, Echo Station, Skyline Gardens. \nThe Evergreen Circle has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater, Gilded Archway, Quartz District, Azure Gardens, Opal Theater, Brass Lantern Tavern, Echo Station. \nThe Umbra Theater has overlapping signal areas with Maplewood Conservatory, Beacon Tower, Shadowbridge Arcade, Opal Theater, Yarrow Plaza, Horizon Mall, Velvet Corner. \nThe Rosewood Hall has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway, Duskwood Park, Knight’s Market, Maplewood Conservatory, Yarrow Plaza, Zenith Arena, Jasper Marina, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park, Quartz District, Shadowbridge Arcade, Horizon Mall, Jasper Marina, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Knight’s Market, Maplewood Conservatory, Willowshade Pavilion, Zenith Arena, Jasper Marina, Echo Station, Skyline Gardens. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower, King’s Row, Shadowbridge Arcade, Yarrow Plaza, Zenith Arena, Jasper Marina. \nThe Knight’s Market has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, Zenith Arena, Velvet Corner, Brass Lantern Tavern, Skyline Gardens. \nThe Azure Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Maplewood Conservatory, Shadowbridge Arcade, Opal Theater, Yarrow Plaza, Horizon Mall, Velvet Corner. \nThe Maplewood Conservatory has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater, Horizon Mall, Jasper Marina, Brass Lantern Tavern, Skyline Gardens. \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, King’s Row, Brass Lantern Tavern, Echo Station, Skyline Gardens. \nThe Willowshade Pavilion has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade, Yarrow Plaza, Jasper Marina, Echo Station, Skyline Gardens. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade, Opal Theater, Horizon Mall. \nThe Shadowbridge Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater, Yarrow Plaza, Jasper Marina, Brass Lantern Tavern, Skyline Gardens. \nThe Opal Theater has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, Horizon Mall, Zenith Arena, Jasper Marina, Brass Lantern Tavern, Skyline Gardens. \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Horizon Mall, Jasper Marina, Velvet Corner, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Zenith Arena, Jasper Marina, Velvet Corner, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Zenith Arena has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina, Echo Station. \nThe Jasper Marina has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Velvet Corner has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 25 major locations in the city: Moonlit Promenade, Haven Docks, Quartz District, Temple Square, Granite Plaza, Velvet Corner, Umbra Theater, Yarrow Plaza, Nimbus Plaza, Shadowbridge Arcade, Sapphire Arena, Ironbridge Crossing, Northwind Tower, Flint Forge Quarter, Amber Plaza, Twilight Harbor, Knight’s Market, King’s Row, Westgate Station, Maplewood Conservatory, Pennywhistle Arcade, Cobalt Market, Evergreen Circle, Mosaic Plaza and Gilded Archway. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Moonlit Promenade has overlapping signal areas with Temple Square, Granite Plaza, Yarrow Plaza, Nimbus Plaza, Shadowbridge Arcade, Sapphire Arena, Ironbridge Crossing, Northwind Tower, Flint Forge Quarter, Amber Plaza, Twilight Harbor, King’s Row, Westgate Station, Evergreen Circle. \nThe Haven Docks has overlapping signal areas with Quartz District, Granite Plaza, Velvet Corner, Nimbus Plaza, Amber Plaza, Knight’s Market, Westgate Station. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Velvet Corner, Nimbus Plaza, Shadowbridge Arcade, Sapphire Arena, Ironbridge Crossing, Flint Forge Quarter, Knight’s Market, King’s Row, Evergreen Circle, Gilded Archway. \nThe Temple Square has overlapping signal areas with Velvet Corner, Yarrow Plaza, Nimbus Plaza, Ironbridge Crossing, Northwind Tower, Amber Plaza, Knight’s Market, King’s Row, Westgate Station, Cobalt Market, Mosaic Plaza. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Velvet Corner, Yarrow Plaza, Sapphire Arena, King’s Row, Cobalt Market, Evergreen Circle, Mosaic Plaza, Gilded Archway. \nThe Velvet Corner has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, Nimbus Plaza, Shadowbridge Arcade, Sapphire Arena, Westgate Station, Mosaic Plaza. \nThe Umbra Theater has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, Nimbus Plaza, Sapphire Arena, Ironbridge Crossing, Twilight Harbor, King’s Row, Evergreen Circle, Mosaic Plaza. \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Nimbus Plaza, Sapphire Arena, Ironbridge Crossing, Twilight Harbor, King’s Row, Westgate Station, Maplewood Conservatory, Pennywhistle Arcade, Cobalt Market, Gilded Archway. \nThe Nimbus Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Flint Forge Quarter, Amber Plaza, King’s Row, Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Shadowbridge Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena, Northwind Tower, Flint Forge Quarter, Amber Plaza, Twilight Harbor, Knight’s Market, King’s Row, Mosaic Plaza. \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with Ironbridge Crossing, Amber Plaza, Knight’s Market, Pennywhistle Arcade, Mosaic Plaza. \nThe Ironbridge Crossing has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, King’s Row, Cobalt Market, Mosaic Plaza, Gilded Archway. \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade, Cobalt Market, Evergreen Circle, Mosaic Plaza, Gilded Archway. \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Amber Plaza, Twilight Harbor, King’s Row, Evergreen Circle, Mosaic Plaza. \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Knight’s Market, Westgate Station, Evergreen Circle. \nThe Twilight Harbor has overlapping signal areas with Knight’s Market, King’s Row, Westgate Station, Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Knight’s Market has overlapping signal areas with Westgate Station, Pennywhistle Arcade, Cobalt Market, Mosaic Plaza. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Maplewood Conservatory, Mosaic Plaza. \nThe Maplewood Conservatory has overlapping signal areas with Evergreen Circle, Gilded Archway. \nThe Cobalt Market has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza, Gilded Archway. \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 25 major locations in the city: Granite Plaza, King’s Row, Umbra Theater, Jasper Marina, Shadowbridge Arcade, Silvercrest Observatory, Beacon Tower, Maplewood Conservatory, Moonlit Promenade, Zenith Arena, Skyline Gardens, Union Square Market, Evergreen Circle, Duskwood Park, Sapphire Arena, Brass Lantern Tavern, Riverstone Wharf, Ironbridge Crossing, Yarrow Plaza, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Echo Station, Oakshade Library, Cobalt Market, Quartz District and Dragon’s Gate. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater, Jasper Marina, Shadowbridge Arcade, Evergreen Circle, Duskwood Park, Brass Lantern Tavern, Ironbridge Crossing, Yarrow Plaza, Echo Station, Dragon’s Gate. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Maplewood Conservatory, Moonlit Promenade, Zenith Arena, Skyline Gardens, Union Square Market, Evergreen Circle, Sapphire Arena, Riverstone Wharf, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Echo Station, Cobalt Market, Quartz District. \nThe Umbra Theater has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower, Skyline Gardens, Union Square Market. \nThe Jasper Marina has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade, Silvercrest Observatory, Beacon Tower, Maplewood Conservatory, Moonlit Promenade, Union Square Market, Evergreen Circle, Duskwood Park, Ironbridge Crossing, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Oakshade Library. \nThe Shadowbridge Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory, Duskwood Park, Sapphire Arena, Ironbridge Crossing, Echo Station, Cobalt Market. \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower, Yarrow Plaza, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Echo Station, Dragon’s Gate. \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with Maplewood Conservatory, Zenith Arena, Skyline Gardens, Union Square Market, Brass Lantern Tavern, Yarrow Plaza, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Quartz District, Dragon’s Gate. \nThe Maplewood Conservatory has overlapping signal areas with Moonlit Promenade, Union Square Market, Sapphire Arena, Brass Lantern Tavern, Riverstone Wharf, Echo Station, Cobalt Market, Quartz District. \nThe Moonlit Promenade has overlapping signal areas with Zenith Arena, Union Square Market, Sapphire Arena, Brass Lantern Tavern, Ironbridge Crossing, Yarrow Plaza, Oakshade Library. \nThe Zenith Arena has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park, Sapphire Arena, Ironbridge Crossing, Oakshade Library, Cobalt Market, Quartz District, Dragon’s Gate. \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Union Square Market, Duskwood Park, Riverstone Wharf, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Echo Station, Oakshade Library, Cobalt Market, Quartz District. \nThe Union Square Market has overlapping signal areas with Evergreen Circle, Duskwood Park, Sapphire Arena, Brass Lantern Tavern, Yarrow Plaza, Echo Station, Cobalt Market, Quartz District. \nThe Evergreen Circle has overlapping signal areas with Ironbridge Crossing, Yarrow Plaza, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Echo Station, Cobalt Market. \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Echo Station, Oakshade Library. \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Riverstone Wharf, Ironbridge Crossing, Yarrow Plaza, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Echo Station, Oakshade Library, Quartz District, Dragon’s Gate. \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, Dragon’s Gate. \nThe Riverstone Wharf has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, Echo Station, Cobalt Market, Dragon’s Gate. \nThe Ironbridge Crossing has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station, Dragon’s Gate. \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Dragon’s Gate. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Quartz District. \nThe Oakshade Library has overlapping signal areas with Cobalt Market, Quartz District. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Dragon’s Gate. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 25 major locations in the city: Flint Forge Quarter, Temple Square, Velvet Corner, Shadowbridge Arcade, Gilded Archway, Flare Alley, Beacon Tower, Umbra Theater, Westgate Station, Amber Plaza, Brass Lantern Tavern, Lunar Pier, Cobalt Market, Echo Station, Union Square Market, Lighthouse Point, Moonlit Promenade, Willowshade Pavilion, Primrose Boulevard, Granite Plaza, Duskwood Park, Rosewood Hall, Twilight Harbor, Horizon Mall and Haven Docks. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade, Gilded Archway, Flare Alley, Westgate Station, Amber Plaza, Lunar Pier, Union Square Market, Moonlit Promenade, Willowshade Pavilion, Duskwood Park. \nThe Temple Square has overlapping signal areas with Velvet Corner, Flare Alley, Amber Plaza, Brass Lantern Tavern, Cobalt Market, Union Square Market, Moonlit Promenade, Willowshade Pavilion, Primrose Boulevard, Duskwood Park, Twilight Harbor. \nThe Velvet Corner has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade, Flare Alley, Beacon Tower, Umbra Theater, Echo Station, Willowshade Pavilion, Rosewood Hall. \nThe Shadowbridge Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Flare Alley, Beacon Tower, Umbra Theater, Westgate Station, Brass Lantern Tavern, Union Square Market, Moonlit Promenade, Duskwood Park, Horizon Mall, Haven Docks. \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower, Amber Plaza, Brass Lantern Tavern, Lunar Pier, Cobalt Market, Moonlit Promenade, Primrose Boulevard, Granite Plaza, Rosewood Hall, Twilight Harbor. \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower, Westgate Station, Cobalt Market, Union Square Market, Primrose Boulevard, Granite Plaza, Duskwood Park, Rosewood Hall, Twilight Harbor, Horizon Mall, Haven Docks. \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Echo Station, Lighthouse Point, Rosewood Hall, Horizon Mall, Haven Docks. \nThe Umbra Theater has overlapping signal areas with Cobalt Market, Echo Station, Twilight Harbor. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier, Echo Station, Twilight Harbor, Horizon Mall. \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Lunar Pier, Echo Station, Lighthouse Point, Primrose Boulevard, Duskwood Park, Rosewood Hall, Horizon Mall, Haven Docks. \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with Moonlit Promenade, Willowshade Pavilion, Primrose Boulevard, Rosewood Hall. \nThe Lunar Pier has overlapping signal areas with Lighthouse Point, Willowshade Pavilion, Primrose Boulevard, Duskwood Park, Twilight Harbor, Horizon Mall, Haven Docks. \nThe Cobalt Market has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station, Union Square Market, Lighthouse Point, Rosewood Hall, Haven Docks. \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with Lighthouse Point, Granite Plaza, Horizon Mall, Haven Docks. \nThe Union Square Market has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park, Horizon Mall. \nThe Lighthouse Point has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Primrose Boulevard, Horizon Mall. \nThe Moonlit Promenade has overlapping signal areas with Primrose Boulevard, Granite Plaza, Duskwood Park, Horizon Mall. \nThe Willowshade Pavilion has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza, Duskwood Park, Horizon Mall. \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza, Horizon Mall, Haven Docks. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park, Rosewood Hall, Twilight Harbor, Horizon Mall. \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Rosewood Hall, Haven Docks. \nThe Rosewood Hall has overlapping signal areas with Haven Docks. \nThe Twilight Harbor has overlapping signal areas with Horizon Mall. \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Haven Docks. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 25 major locations in the city: Azure Gardens, Quarry Point, Beacon Tower, Sapphire Arena, King’s Row, Amber Plaza, Echo Station, Evergreen Circle, Knight’s Market, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Quartz District, Brass Lantern Tavern, Westgate Station, Lighthouse Point, Primrose Boulevard, Horizon Mall, Ironbridge Crossing, Granite Plaza, Northwind Tower, Nimbus Plaza, Yarrow Plaza, Riverstone Wharf, Gilded Archway, Copper Clock Square and Willowshade Pavilion. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Azure Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Quarry Point, Sapphire Arena, King’s Row, Amber Plaza, Echo Station, Westgate Station, Primrose Boulevard, Northwind Tower, Nimbus Plaza, Riverstone Wharf, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Quarry Point has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena, King’s Row, Amber Plaza, Evergreen Circle, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Brass Lantern Tavern, Primrose Boulevard, Ironbridge Crossing, Copper Clock Square, Willowshade Pavilion. \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Lighthouse Point, Primrose Boulevard, Horizon Mall, Granite Plaza, Northwind Tower, Nimbus Plaza, Yarrow Plaza, Riverstone Wharf, Gilded Archway. \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Echo Station, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Quartz District, Brass Lantern Tavern, Primrose Boulevard, Horizon Mall, Nimbus Plaza, Yarrow Plaza, Willowshade Pavilion. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Amber Plaza, Evergreen Circle, Knight’s Market, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Westgate Station, Lighthouse Point, Granite Plaza, Nimbus Plaza, Yarrow Plaza, Gilded Archway. \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Primrose Boulevard, Ironbridge Crossing, Granite Plaza, Northwind Tower, Riverstone Wharf, Gilded Archway, Willowshade Pavilion. \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with Knight’s Market, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Quartz District, Lighthouse Point, Primrose Boulevard, Horizon Mall, Granite Plaza, Northwind Tower, Riverstone Wharf, Willowshade Pavilion. \nThe Evergreen Circle has overlapping signal areas with Knight’s Market, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Brass Lantern Tavern, Granite Plaza, Northwind Tower, Gilded Archway, Willowshade Pavilion. \nThe Knight’s Market has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Ironbridge Crossing, Gilded Archway, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Horizon Mall, Ironbridge Crossing, Nimbus Plaza, Riverstone Wharf, Willowshade Pavilion. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Horizon Mall, Granite Plaza, Gilded Archway, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with Primrose Boulevard, Northwind Tower, Nimbus Plaza, Yarrow Plaza, Riverstone Wharf, Willowshade Pavilion. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Lighthouse Point, Northwind Tower, Willowshade Pavilion. \nThe Lighthouse Point has overlapping signal areas with Primrose Boulevard, Horizon Mall, Nimbus Plaza, Yarrow Plaza, Copper Clock Square, Willowshade Pavilion. \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with Horizon Mall, Northwind Tower, Gilded Archway. \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, Willowshade Pavilion. \nThe Ironbridge Crossing has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza, Northwind Tower, Yarrow Plaza, Willowshade Pavilion. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Nimbus Plaza, Riverstone Wharf, Gilded Archway. \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with Copper Clock Square. \nThe Nimbus Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Riverstone Wharf, Gilded Archway. \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Riverstone Wharf, Willowshade Pavilion. \nThe Riverstone Wharf has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway. \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 25 major locations in the city: Jasper Marina, Maplewood Conservatory, Brass Lantern Tavern, Skyline Gardens, Haven Docks, Westgate Station, Beacon Tower, Union Square Market, Cobalt Market, Lunar Pier, Gilded Archway, Primrose Boulevard, Rosewood Hall, Granite Plaza, Umbra Theater, Copper Clock Square, Northwind Tower, Willowshade Pavilion, Moonlit Promenade, Temple Square, Jade Fountain, Echo Station, Shadowbridge Arcade, Silvercrest Observatory and Twilight Harbor. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Jasper Marina has overlapping signal areas with Maplewood Conservatory, Skyline Gardens, Westgate Station, Union Square Market, Cobalt Market, Lunar Pier, Primrose Boulevard, Rosewood Hall, Copper Clock Square, Willowshade Pavilion, Temple Square, Shadowbridge Arcade, Silvercrest Observatory. \nThe Maplewood Conservatory has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Skyline Gardens, Haven Docks, Beacon Tower, Gilded Archway, Granite Plaza, Umbra Theater, Moonlit Promenade, Temple Square. \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens, Haven Docks, Westgate Station, Cobalt Market, Rosewood Hall, Granite Plaza, Umbra Theater, Moonlit Promenade, Temple Square, Silvercrest Observatory, Twilight Harbor. \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Haven Docks, Westgate Station, Union Square Market, Gilded Archway, Northwind Tower, Jade Fountain, Silvercrest Observatory. \nThe Haven Docks has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower, Lunar Pier, Gilded Archway, Granite Plaza, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower, Union Square Market, Lunar Pier, Granite Plaza, Northwind Tower, Moonlit Promenade, Temple Square, Echo Station, Shadowbridge Arcade. \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with Cobalt Market, Gilded Archway, Primrose Boulevard, Granite Plaza, Umbra Theater, Temple Square, Jade Fountain, Echo Station, Shadowbridge Arcade, Silvercrest Observatory, Twilight Harbor. \nThe Union Square Market has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier, Primrose Boulevard, Rosewood Hall, Granite Plaza, Willowshade Pavilion, Moonlit Promenade, Temple Square. \nThe Cobalt Market has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway, Primrose Boulevard, Copper Clock Square, Temple Square, Echo Station, Shadowbridge Arcade. \nThe Lunar Pier has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway, Granite Plaza, Moonlit Promenade, Temple Square, Shadowbridge Arcade, Twilight Harbor. \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater, Moonlit Promenade, Temple Square, Shadowbridge Arcade, Twilight Harbor. \nThe Rosewood Hall has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza, Northwind Tower, Willowshade Pavilion, Moonlit Promenade, Silvercrest Observatory. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater, Copper Clock Square, Northwind Tower, Temple Square, Jade Fountain, Silvercrest Observatory. \nThe Umbra Theater has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Moonlit Promenade, Temple Square, Jade Fountain, Echo Station, Shadowbridge Arcade, Silvercrest Observatory, Twilight Harbor. \nThe Copper Clock Square has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, Willowshade Pavilion, Moonlit Promenade, Echo Station. \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Jade Fountain, Twilight Harbor. \nThe Willowshade Pavilion has overlapping signal areas with Jade Fountain, Twilight Harbor. \nThe Temple Square has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade, Silvercrest Observatory. \nThe Jade Fountain has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station, Silvercrest Observatory. \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory, Twilight Harbor. \nThe Shadowbridge Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Twilight Harbor. \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with Twilight Harbor. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 25 major locations in the city: Dragon’s Gate, Azure Gardens, Skyline Gardens, Westgate Station, Quarry Point, Jasper Marina, King’s Row, Twilight Harbor, Haven Docks, Duskwood Park, Gilded Archway, Flint Forge Quarter, Jade Fountain, Primrose Boulevard, Horizon Mall, Evergreen Circle, Echo Station, Riverstone Wharf, Maplewood Conservatory, Velvet Corner, Flare Alley, Yarrow Plaza, Union Square Market, Copper Clock Square and Beacon Tower. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Dragon’s Gate has overlapping signal areas with Azure Gardens, Jasper Marina, Duskwood Park, Flint Forge Quarter, Jade Fountain, Primrose Boulevard, Riverstone Wharf, Maplewood Conservatory, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Azure Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens, Westgate Station, Quarry Point, Twilight Harbor, Haven Docks, Flint Forge Quarter, Jade Fountain, Maplewood Conservatory, Velvet Corner, Flare Alley, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Westgate Station, King’s Row, Twilight Harbor, Duskwood Park, Flint Forge Quarter, Jade Fountain, Evergreen Circle, Velvet Corner, Flare Alley, Yarrow Plaza. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina, King’s Row, Duskwood Park, Gilded Archway, Flint Forge Quarter, Yarrow Plaza, Beacon Tower. \nThe Quarry Point has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Gilded Archway, Flint Forge Quarter, Primrose Boulevard, Evergreen Circle, Echo Station, Maplewood Conservatory, Velvet Corner, Yarrow Plaza. \nThe Jasper Marina has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Haven Docks, Jade Fountain, Primrose Boulevard, Horizon Mall, Riverstone Wharf, Flare Alley, Yarrow Plaza, Copper Clock Square, Beacon Tower. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Twilight Harbor, Haven Docks, Flint Forge Quarter, Jade Fountain, Horizon Mall, Echo Station, Riverstone Wharf, Velvet Corner, Yarrow Plaza, Copper Clock Square, Beacon Tower. \nThe Twilight Harbor has overlapping signal areas with Haven Docks, Flint Forge Quarter, Horizon Mall, Evergreen Circle, Riverstone Wharf, Velvet Corner, Union Square Market. \nThe Haven Docks has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park, Gilded Archway, Jade Fountain, Evergreen Circle, Velvet Corner, Yarrow Plaza, Union Square Market, Beacon Tower. \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Flint Forge Quarter, Evergreen Circle, Echo Station, Riverstone Wharf, Maplewood Conservatory, Flare Alley, Copper Clock Square, Beacon Tower. \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Maplewood Conservatory, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Jade Fountain, Primrose Boulevard, Evergreen Circle, Velvet Corner, Flare Alley. \nThe Jade Fountain has overlapping signal areas with Horizon Mall, Echo Station, Riverstone Wharf, Flare Alley, Union Square Market, Copper Clock Square, Beacon Tower. \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with Evergreen Circle, Echo Station, Yarrow Plaza. \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Evergreen Circle, Echo Station, Riverstone Wharf, Flare Alley, Yarrow Plaza, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Evergreen Circle has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station, Riverstone Wharf, Maplewood Conservatory, Yarrow Plaza, Beacon Tower. \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with Velvet Corner. \nThe Maplewood Conservatory has overlapping signal areas with Velvet Corner, Flare Alley. \nThe Velvet Corner has overlapping signal areas with Flare Alley, Yarrow Plaza, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Copper Clock Square has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 25 major locations in the city: Ivory Spire Cathedral, Dragon’s Gate, Twilight Harbor, Lighthouse Point, Jasper Marina, Westgate Station, Flint Forge Quarter, Beacon Tower, King’s Row, Copper Clock Square, Maplewood Conservatory, Mosaic Plaza, Horizon Mall, Evergreen Circle, Northwind Tower, Shadowbridge Arcade, Duskwood Park, Quarry Point, Granite Plaza, Ironbridge Crossing, Haven Docks, Silvercrest Observatory, Azure Gardens, Brass Lantern Tavern and Sapphire Arena. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Dragon’s Gate, Westgate Station, Flint Forge Quarter, Beacon Tower, Copper Clock Square, Mosaic Plaza, Northwind Tower, Shadowbridge Arcade, Granite Plaza, Azure Gardens, Sapphire Arena. \nThe Dragon’s Gate has overlapping signal areas with Twilight Harbor, Lighthouse Point, Jasper Marina, Beacon Tower, King’s Row, Copper Clock Square, Mosaic Plaza, Evergreen Circle, Northwind Tower, Shadowbridge Arcade, Duskwood Park, Haven Docks, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Twilight Harbor has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina, King’s Row, Maplewood Conservatory, Horizon Mall, Northwind Tower, Quarry Point, Granite Plaza, Haven Docks, Azure Gardens, Sapphire Arena. \nThe Lighthouse Point has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina, Westgate Station, Flint Forge Quarter, Horizon Mall, Evergreen Circle, Shadowbridge Arcade, Granite Plaza, Sapphire Arena. \nThe Jasper Marina has overlapping signal areas with Copper Clock Square, Mosaic Plaza, Evergreen Circle, Granite Plaza, Ironbridge Crossing, Haven Docks. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower, Maplewood Conservatory, Evergreen Circle, Northwind Tower, Duskwood Park, Granite Plaza, Ironbridge Crossing, Azure Gardens, Brass Lantern Tavern, Sapphire Arena. \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower, Maplewood Conservatory, Mosaic Plaza, Northwind Tower, Ironbridge Crossing, Haven Docks, Sapphire Arena. \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Horizon Mall, Quarry Point, Granite Plaza, Silvercrest Observatory, Sapphire Arena. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Maplewood Conservatory, Horizon Mall, Ironbridge Crossing, Haven Docks, Silvercrest Observatory, Azure Gardens, Sapphire Arena. \nThe Copper Clock Square has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, Shadowbridge Arcade, Granite Plaza, Silvercrest Observatory, Azure Gardens, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Maplewood Conservatory has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza, Ironbridge Crossing, Haven Docks, Silvercrest Observatory, Azure Gardens, Brass Lantern Tavern, Sapphire Arena. \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Sapphire Arena. \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, Quarry Point, Ironbridge Crossing, Azure Gardens. \nThe Evergreen Circle has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, Shadowbridge Arcade, Quarry Point, Granite Plaza, Haven Docks, Silvercrest Observatory, Azure Gardens, Sapphire Arena. \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza, Silvercrest Observatory, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Shadowbridge Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park, Azure Gardens, Sapphire Arena. \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Ironbridge Crossing, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Quarry Point has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza, Haven Docks, Brass Lantern Tavern, Sapphire Arena. \nThe Ironbridge Crossing has overlapping signal areas with Haven Docks, Silvercrest Observatory, Brass Lantern Tavern, Sapphire Arena. \nThe Haven Docks has overlapping signal areas with Azure Gardens, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena. \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 25 major locations in the city: Quarry Point, Copper Clock Square, Maplewood Conservatory, Evergreen Circle, Flare Alley, Riverstone Wharf, Knight’s Market, Temple Square, Granite Plaza, King’s Row, Dragon’s Gate, Duskwood Park, Zenith Arena, Twilight Harbor, Oakshade Library, Sapphire Arena, Rosewood Hall, Lunar Pier, Northwind Tower, Jade Fountain, Nimbus Plaza, Flint Forge Quarter, Quartz District, Beacon Tower and Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Quarry Point has overlapping signal areas with Copper Clock Square, Maplewood Conservatory, Evergreen Circle, Flare Alley, Knight’s Market, King’s Row, Duskwood Park, Oakshade Library, Lunar Pier, Beacon Tower. \nThe Copper Clock Square has overlapping signal areas with Maplewood Conservatory, Riverstone Wharf, Knight’s Market, Temple Square, King’s Row, Dragon’s Gate, Twilight Harbor, Sapphire Arena, Rosewood Hall, Lunar Pier, Northwind Tower, Jade Fountain, Quartz District. \nThe Maplewood Conservatory has overlapping signal areas with Flare Alley, Riverstone Wharf, Granite Plaza, King’s Row, Northwind Tower, Nimbus Plaza, Beacon Tower. \nThe Evergreen Circle has overlapping signal areas with Flare Alley, Knight’s Market, Temple Square, Twilight Harbor, Rosewood Hall, Northwind Tower, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Knight’s Market, Dragon’s Gate, Duskwood Park, Zenith Arena, Oakshade Library, Sapphire Arena, Lunar Pier. \nThe Riverstone Wharf has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Duskwood Park, Sapphire Arena, Northwind Tower, Jade Fountain, Nimbus Plaza, Quartz District. \nThe Knight’s Market has overlapping signal areas with Temple Square, Granite Plaza, Duskwood Park, Twilight Harbor, Oakshade Library, Sapphire Arena, Lunar Pier, Jade Fountain, Flint Forge Quarter, Beacon Tower, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Temple Square has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza, King’s Row, Duskwood Park, Twilight Harbor, Beacon Tower. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Dragon’s Gate, Duskwood Park, Northwind Tower, Flint Forge Quarter, Beacon Tower, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Dragon’s Gate, Duskwood Park, Zenith Arena, Rosewood Hall, Lunar Pier, Jade Fountain, Quartz District. \nThe Dragon’s Gate has overlapping signal areas with Zenith Arena, Twilight Harbor, Sapphire Arena, Rosewood Hall, Northwind Tower, Jade Fountain, Nimbus Plaza. \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Twilight Harbor, Oakshade Library, Sapphire Arena. \nThe Zenith Arena has overlapping signal areas with Twilight Harbor, Oakshade Library, Sapphire Arena, Lunar Pier, Flint Forge Quarter, Quartz District, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Twilight Harbor has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena, Northwind Tower, Jade Fountain, Flint Forge Quarter, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Oakshade Library has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, Quartz District. \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with Rosewood Hall, Lunar Pier, Northwind Tower, Jade Fountain. \nThe Rosewood Hall has overlapping signal areas with Nimbus Plaza, Quartz District, Beacon Tower. \nThe Lunar Pier has overlapping signal areas with Jade Fountain, Nimbus Plaza, Flint Forge Quarter, Beacon Tower. \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with Jade Fountain, Nimbus Plaza, Beacon Tower, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Jade Fountain has overlapping signal areas with Nimbus Plaza, Flint Forge Quarter, Quartz District. \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 25 major locations in the city: Silvercrest Observatory, Gilded Archway, Flare Alley, Amber Plaza, Beacon Tower, Jasper Marina, Union Square Market, Umbra Theater, Oakshade Library, Rosewood Hall, Moonlit Promenade, Opal Theater, Copper Clock Square, Northwind Tower, Dragon’s Gate, Cobalt Market, Nimbus Plaza, Pennywhistle Arcade, Knight’s Market, Lunar Pier, Jade Fountain, Maplewood Conservatory, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Brass Lantern Tavern and Zenith Arena. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway, Flare Alley, Opal Theater, Dragon’s Gate, Cobalt Market, Knight’s Market, Jade Fountain, Zenith Arena. \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Amber Plaza, Jasper Marina, Umbra Theater, Oakshade Library, Rosewood Hall, Copper Clock Square, Jade Fountain, Maplewood Conservatory, Brass Lantern Tavern, Zenith Arena. \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Amber Plaza, Beacon Tower, Umbra Theater, Oakshade Library, Rosewood Hall, Opal Theater, Nimbus Plaza, Pennywhistle Arcade, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina, Oakshade Library, Northwind Tower, Cobalt Market, Knight’s Market, Lunar Pier. \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater, Oakshade Library, Cobalt Market, Nimbus Plaza, Lunar Pier, Jade Fountain, Maplewood Conservatory, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Jasper Marina has overlapping signal areas with Oakshade Library, Moonlit Promenade, Copper Clock Square, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Union Square Market has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater, Cobalt Market, Nimbus Plaza, Pennywhistle Arcade, Knight’s Market, Jade Fountain, Maplewood Conservatory, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Umbra Theater has overlapping signal areas with Oakshade Library, Moonlit Promenade, Opal Theater, Nimbus Plaza, Knight’s Market, Maplewood Conservatory, Zenith Arena. \nThe Oakshade Library has overlapping signal areas with Rosewood Hall, Northwind Tower, Cobalt Market, Nimbus Plaza, Pennywhistle Arcade, Knight’s Market, Jade Fountain, Maplewood Conservatory, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Zenith Arena. \nThe Rosewood Hall has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater, Copper Clock Square, Northwind Tower, Dragon’s Gate, Knight’s Market, Lunar Pier, Jade Fountain, Brass Lantern Tavern, Zenith Arena. \nThe Moonlit Promenade has overlapping signal areas with Copper Clock Square, Northwind Tower, Jade Fountain, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Opal Theater has overlapping signal areas with Nimbus Plaza, Pennywhistle Arcade, Lunar Pier, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Copper Clock Square has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, Dragon’s Gate, Pennywhistle Arcade, Lunar Pier, Maplewood Conservatory, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with Cobalt Market, Zenith Arena. \nThe Dragon’s Gate has overlapping signal areas with Cobalt Market, Knight’s Market, Lunar Pier, Jade Fountain, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Brass Lantern Tavern, Zenith Arena. \nThe Cobalt Market has overlapping signal areas with Nimbus Plaza, Pennywhistle Arcade, Knight’s Market, Lunar Pier, Jade Fountain, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Nimbus Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Maplewood Conservatory, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Knight’s Market, Lunar Pier, Jade Fountain, Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Knight’s Market has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral, Zenith Arena. \nThe Lunar Pier has overlapping signal areas with Jade Fountain, Maplewood Conservatory, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Jade Fountain has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Maplewood Conservatory has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral, Zenith Arena. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Zenith Arena. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 25 major locations in the city: Umbra Theater, Velvet Corner, Jade Fountain, Westgate Station, Northwind Tower, Duskwood Park, Silvercrest Observatory, Willowshade Pavilion, Cobalt Market, Lunar Pier, Primrose Boulevard, Rosewood Hall, Opal Theater, Brass Lantern Tavern, Granite Plaza, Copper Clock Square, Amber Plaza, Yarrow Plaza, Echo Station, Skyline Gardens, Pennywhistle Arcade, Oakshade Library, Union Square Market, Shadowbridge Arcade and Moonlit Promenade. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Umbra Theater has overlapping signal areas with Velvet Corner, Jade Fountain, Westgate Station, Northwind Tower, Duskwood Park, Willowshade Pavilion, Cobalt Market, Primrose Boulevard, Opal Theater, Yarrow Plaza, Pennywhistle Arcade, Union Square Market. \nThe Velvet Corner has overlapping signal areas with Jade Fountain, Silvercrest Observatory, Cobalt Market, Primrose Boulevard, Rosewood Hall, Opal Theater, Brass Lantern Tavern, Copper Clock Square, Amber Plaza, Skyline Gardens, Oakshade Library. \nThe Jade Fountain has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, Silvercrest Observatory, Rosewood Hall, Copper Clock Square, Amber Plaza, Echo Station. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park, Lunar Pier, Copper Clock Square, Union Square Market, Shadowbridge Arcade. \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park, Silvercrest Observatory, Willowshade Pavilion, Primrose Boulevard, Opal Theater, Brass Lantern Tavern, Granite Plaza, Copper Clock Square, Echo Station, Union Square Market, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory, Cobalt Market, Primrose Boulevard, Rosewood Hall, Opal Theater, Skyline Gardens, Oakshade Library, Shadowbridge Arcade, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with Primrose Boulevard, Opal Theater, Amber Plaza, Oakshade Library, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Willowshade Pavilion has overlapping signal areas with Primrose Boulevard, Rosewood Hall, Opal Theater, Yarrow Plaza, Skyline Gardens, Oakshade Library, Shadowbridge Arcade. \nThe Cobalt Market has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier, Primrose Boulevard, Yarrow Plaza, Pennywhistle Arcade, Shadowbridge Arcade, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Lunar Pier has overlapping signal areas with Amber Plaza, Skyline Gardens, Oakshade Library, Union Square Market, Shadowbridge Arcade. \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with Rosewood Hall, Opal Theater, Copper Clock Square, Yarrow Plaza, Echo Station, Skyline Gardens, Pennywhistle Arcade, Oakshade Library, Union Square Market, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Rosewood Hall has overlapping signal areas with Copper Clock Square, Yarrow Plaza, Pennywhistle Arcade, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Opal Theater has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza, Copper Clock Square, Echo Station, Union Square Market, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, Echo Station, Shadowbridge Arcade, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Amber Plaza, Echo Station, Skyline Gardens, Oakshade Library, Shadowbridge Arcade, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Copper Clock Square has overlapping signal areas with Amber Plaza, Skyline Gardens, Oakshade Library, Shadowbridge Arcade. \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station, Skyline Gardens, Union Square Market, Shadowbridge Arcade, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens, Pennywhistle Arcade, Oakshade Library, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade. \nThe Oakshade Library has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Union Square Market has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 25 major locations in the city: Copper Clock Square, Temple Square, Opal Theater, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Quarry Point, King’s Row, Jade Fountain, Shadowbridge Arcade, Cobalt Market, Lunar Pier, Sapphire Arena, Yarrow Plaza, Flint Forge Quarter, Nimbus Plaza, Dragon’s Gate, Quartz District, Haven Docks, Duskwood Park, Granite Plaza, Rosewood Hall, Knight’s Market, Amber Plaza, Gilded Archway, Pennywhistle Arcade and Beacon Tower. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Copper Clock Square has overlapping signal areas with Temple Square, Sapphire Arena, Duskwood Park, Granite Plaza, Rosewood Hall, Knight’s Market. \nThe Temple Square has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater, Ivory Spire Cathedral, King’s Row, Lunar Pier, Yarrow Plaza, Haven Docks, Duskwood Park, Rosewood Hall, Knight’s Market, Amber Plaza, Pennywhistle Arcade, Beacon Tower. \nThe Opal Theater has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena, Flint Forge Quarter, Nimbus Plaza, Dragon’s Gate, Haven Docks, Granite Plaza, Amber Plaza. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Quarry Point, King’s Row, Jade Fountain, Shadowbridge Arcade, Sapphire Arena, Flint Forge Quarter, Haven Docks, Granite Plaza, Rosewood Hall, Gilded Archway, Beacon Tower. \nThe Quarry Point has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Jade Fountain, Shadowbridge Arcade, Nimbus Plaza, Quartz District, Granite Plaza, Rosewood Hall, Knight’s Market. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade, Sapphire Arena, Nimbus Plaza, Quartz District, Haven Docks, Granite Plaza, Amber Plaza, Gilded Archway. \nThe Jade Fountain has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade, Cobalt Market, Dragon’s Gate, Granite Plaza, Rosewood Hall, Knight’s Market, Amber Plaza, Pennywhistle Arcade, Beacon Tower. \nThe Shadowbridge Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier, Yarrow Plaza, Nimbus Plaza, Quartz District, Haven Docks, Gilded Archway, Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Cobalt Market has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena, Yarrow Plaza, Nimbus Plaza, Haven Docks, Rosewood Hall, Amber Plaza, Beacon Tower. \nThe Lunar Pier has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena, Quartz District, Haven Docks, Rosewood Hall, Gilded Archway, Beacon Tower. \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with Flint Forge Quarter, Duskwood Park, Rosewood Hall, Amber Plaza, Pennywhistle Arcade, Beacon Tower. \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Nimbus Plaza, Dragon’s Gate, Haven Docks, Duskwood Park, Rosewood Hall, Gilded Archway, Pennywhistle Arcade, Beacon Tower. \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Rosewood Hall, Pennywhistle Arcade, Beacon Tower. \nThe Nimbus Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Dragon’s Gate, Quartz District, Granite Plaza, Knight’s Market. \nThe Dragon’s Gate has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park, Knight’s Market, Gilded Archway. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Haven Docks, Duskwood Park, Knight’s Market, Amber Plaza, Gilded Archway, Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Haven Docks has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway. \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza, Rosewood Hall, Amber Plaza. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Rosewood Hall, Knight’s Market, Amber Plaza, Gilded Archway. \nThe Rosewood Hall has overlapping signal areas with Knight’s Market, Beacon Tower. \nThe Knight’s Market has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade, Beacon Tower. \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 25 major locations in the city: Dragon’s Gate, Lighthouse Point, Northwind Tower, Knight’s Market, Sapphire Arena, Echo Station, Union Square Market, Haven Docks, Mosaic Plaza, Quartz District, Silvercrest Observatory, Granite Plaza, Pennywhistle Arcade, Flare Alley, Oakshade Library, Yarrow Plaza, Maplewood Conservatory, Opal Theater, Jasper Marina, Westgate Station, Lunar Pier, Moonlit Promenade, Beacon Tower, Nimbus Plaza and Flint Forge Quarter. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Dragon’s Gate has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, Knight’s Market, Sapphire Arena, Echo Station, Silvercrest Observatory, Maplewood Conservatory, Opal Theater, Jasper Marina, Moonlit Promenade, Beacon Tower, Flint Forge Quarter. \nThe Lighthouse Point has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, Echo Station, Haven Docks, Pennywhistle Arcade, Oakshade Library, Opal Theater, Westgate Station, Beacon Tower. \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station, Haven Docks, Mosaic Plaza, Quartz District, Silvercrest Observatory, Flare Alley, Oakshade Library, Yarrow Plaza, Maplewood Conservatory, Jasper Marina, Westgate Station, Moonlit Promenade, Beacon Tower. \nThe Knight’s Market has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena, Haven Docks, Silvercrest Observatory, Granite Plaza, Pennywhistle Arcade, Maplewood Conservatory, Jasper Marina, Westgate Station, Nimbus Plaza. \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station, Haven Docks, Quartz District, Silvercrest Observatory, Opal Theater, Jasper Marina, Westgate Station, Moonlit Promenade, Beacon Tower, Nimbus Plaza. \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with Haven Docks, Mosaic Plaza, Quartz District, Westgate Station, Moonlit Promenade, Beacon Tower. \nThe Union Square Market has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza, Pennywhistle Arcade, Flare Alley, Oakshade Library, Yarrow Plaza, Jasper Marina, Moonlit Promenade, Nimbus Plaza. \nThe Haven Docks has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza, Oakshade Library, Maplewood Conservatory, Opal Theater, Lunar Pier, Nimbus Plaza, Flint Forge Quarter. \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Quartz District, Silvercrest Observatory, Flare Alley, Opal Theater, Moonlit Promenade, Flint Forge Quarter. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory, Pennywhistle Arcade, Flare Alley, Yarrow Plaza, Opal Theater, Jasper Marina, Nimbus Plaza, Flint Forge Quarter. \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade, Flare Alley, Oakshade Library, Jasper Marina, Westgate Station, Lunar Pier, Nimbus Plaza. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade, Maplewood Conservatory, Jasper Marina, Nimbus Plaza. \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower, Nimbus Plaza. \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, Opal Theater, Jasper Marina, Westgate Station, Lunar Pier, Moonlit Promenade, Nimbus Plaza. \nThe Oakshade Library has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, Opal Theater, Jasper Marina, Westgate Station, Lunar Pier, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower, Nimbus Plaza. \nThe Maplewood Conservatory has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier, Moonlit Promenade, Beacon Tower. \nThe Opal Theater has overlapping signal areas with Westgate Station, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Jasper Marina has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier, Beacon Tower. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower. \nThe Lunar Pier has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower. \nThe Moonlit Promenade has overlapping signal areas with Nimbus Plaza. \nThe Nimbus Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Flint Forge Quarter. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 25 major locations in the city: Twilight Harbor, King’s Row, Flint Forge Quarter, Pennywhistle Arcade, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Sapphire Arena, Velvet Corner, Oakshade Library, Moonlit Promenade, Primrose Boulevard, Quarry Point, Riverstone Wharf, Silvercrest Observatory, Azure Gardens, Jasper Marina, Willowshade Pavilion, Maplewood Conservatory, Evergreen Circle, Flare Alley, Zenith Arena, Quartz District, Beacon Tower, Dragon’s Gate, Union Square Market and Cobalt Market. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Twilight Harbor has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Sapphire Arena, Velvet Corner, Oakshade Library, Quarry Point, Jasper Marina, Willowshade Pavilion, Maplewood Conservatory, Evergreen Circle, Zenith Arena, Beacon Tower, Dragon’s Gate, Union Square Market. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Oakshade Library, Primrose Boulevard, Quarry Point, Willowshade Pavilion, Flare Alley, Quartz District. \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade, Oakshade Library, Moonlit Promenade, Silvercrest Observatory, Willowshade Pavilion, Flare Alley, Dragon’s Gate. \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Oakshade Library, Silvercrest Observatory, Maplewood Conservatory, Flare Alley, Zenith Arena, Quartz District, Beacon Tower, Dragon’s Gate. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Moonlit Promenade, Primrose Boulevard, Quarry Point, Silvercrest Observatory, Willowshade Pavilion, Evergreen Circle, Union Square Market, Cobalt Market. \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with Oakshade Library, Moonlit Promenade, Riverstone Wharf, Silvercrest Observatory, Azure Gardens, Evergreen Circle, Quartz District, Beacon Tower, Dragon’s Gate. \nThe Velvet Corner has overlapping signal areas with Primrose Boulevard, Riverstone Wharf, Silvercrest Observatory, Flare Alley, Quartz District, Dragon’s Gate. \nThe Oakshade Library has overlapping signal areas with Moonlit Promenade, Quarry Point, Azure Gardens, Willowshade Pavilion, Evergreen Circle, Quartz District, Union Square Market, Cobalt Market. \nThe Moonlit Promenade has overlapping signal areas with Riverstone Wharf, Silvercrest Observatory, Willowshade Pavilion, Flare Alley, Zenith Arena, Quartz District. \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with Riverstone Wharf, Willowshade Pavilion, Maplewood Conservatory, Beacon Tower, Union Square Market, Cobalt Market. \nThe Quarry Point has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory, Jasper Marina, Quartz District, Beacon Tower, Dragon’s Gate, Cobalt Market. \nThe Riverstone Wharf has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory, Maplewood Conservatory, Flare Alley, Beacon Tower. \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with Azure Gardens, Willowshade Pavilion, Maplewood Conservatory, Evergreen Circle, Beacon Tower, Cobalt Market. \nThe Azure Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Union Square Market, Cobalt Market. \nThe Jasper Marina has overlapping signal areas with Evergreen Circle, Quartz District, Dragon’s Gate, Union Square Market. \nThe Willowshade Pavilion has overlapping signal areas with Maplewood Conservatory, Flare Alley, Zenith Arena, Beacon Tower, Dragon’s Gate, Union Square Market. \nThe Maplewood Conservatory has overlapping signal areas with Flare Alley, Zenith Arena, Quartz District, Beacon Tower, Dragon’s Gate, Union Square Market, Cobalt Market. \nThe Evergreen Circle has overlapping signal areas with Flare Alley, Zenith Arena, Beacon Tower, Union Square Market, Cobalt Market. \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Quartz District, Beacon Tower, Union Square Market. \nThe Zenith Arena has overlapping signal areas with Quartz District, Union Square Market. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower. \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with Union Square Market. \nThe Union Square Market has overlapping signal areas with Cobalt Market. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 25 major locations in the city: Velvet Corner, Zenith Arena, Gilded Archway, Temple Square, Sapphire Arena, Flint Forge Quarter, Jasper Marina, Lighthouse Point, Beacon Tower, Haven Docks, Shadowbridge Arcade, Skyline Gardens, Oakshade Library, Echo Station, Westgate Station, Maplewood Conservatory, Duskwood Park, Primrose Boulevard, Willowshade Pavilion, Quarry Point, Copper Clock Square, Horizon Mall, Lunar Pier, Ivory Spire Cathedral and King’s Row. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Velvet Corner has overlapping signal areas with Zenith Arena, Sapphire Arena, Lighthouse Point, Skyline Gardens, Oakshade Library, Primrose Boulevard, Willowshade Pavilion, Quarry Point, Copper Clock Square, King’s Row. \nThe Zenith Arena has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway, Temple Square, Jasper Marina, Lighthouse Point, Skyline Gardens, Westgate Station, Duskwood Park, Willowshade Pavilion, Copper Clock Square, Horizon Mall, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Flint Forge Quarter, Jasper Marina, Lighthouse Point, Beacon Tower, Skyline Gardens, Duskwood Park, Copper Clock Square, Horizon Mall, Lunar Pier. \nThe Temple Square has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena, Beacon Tower, Shadowbridge Arcade, Skyline Gardens, Oakshade Library, Maplewood Conservatory, Duskwood Park, Copper Clock Square, Horizon Mall, Lunar Pier, King’s Row. \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with Flint Forge Quarter, Jasper Marina, Lighthouse Point, Beacon Tower, Haven Docks, Oakshade Library, Westgate Station, Primrose Boulevard, Horizon Mall, Lunar Pier, King’s Row. \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower, Shadowbridge Arcade, Duskwood Park, Copper Clock Square, Horizon Mall, Lunar Pier, Ivory Spire Cathedral, King’s Row. \nThe Jasper Marina has overlapping signal areas with Lighthouse Point, Beacon Tower, Shadowbridge Arcade, Oakshade Library, Echo Station, Willowshade Pavilion, Copper Clock Square, Horizon Mall, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Lighthouse Point has overlapping signal areas with Haven Docks, Skyline Gardens, Oakshade Library, Westgate Station, Primrose Boulevard, Willowshade Pavilion. \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with Haven Docks, Shadowbridge Arcade, Echo Station, Maplewood Conservatory, King’s Row. \nThe Haven Docks has overlapping signal areas with Maplewood Conservatory, Quarry Point, Copper Clock Square, Lunar Pier, Ivory Spire Cathedral, King’s Row. \nThe Shadowbridge Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Oakshade Library, Duskwood Park, Quarry Point. \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Oakshade Library, Maplewood Conservatory, Duskwood Park, Willowshade Pavilion, Quarry Point, Copper Clock Square, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Oakshade Library has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station, Horizon Mall, Lunar Pier. \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral, King’s Row. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Maplewood Conservatory, Primrose Boulevard, Willowshade Pavilion. \nThe Maplewood Conservatory has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Lunar Pier, King’s Row. \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Quarry Point, Horizon Mall, King’s Row. \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Copper Clock Square, Horizon Mall, Lunar Pier, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Willowshade Pavilion has overlapping signal areas with Copper Clock Square, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Quarry Point has overlapping signal areas with Copper Clock Square, King’s Row. \nThe Copper Clock Square has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral, King’s Row. \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Lunar Pier has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 25 major locations in the city: Opal Theater, Cobalt Market, Evergreen Circle, Quarry Point, Quartz District, Granite Plaza, Mosaic Plaza, Twilight Harbor, Primrose Boulevard, Azure Gardens, Brass Lantern Tavern, Echo Station, Horizon Mall, Copper Clock Square, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Umbra Theater, Union Square Market, Jade Fountain, Riverstone Wharf, Flare Alley, Yarrow Plaza, Skyline Gardens, Silvercrest Observatory, Northwind Tower and Gilded Archway. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Opal Theater has overlapping signal areas with Cobalt Market, Granite Plaza, Mosaic Plaza, Twilight Harbor, Horizon Mall, Copper Clock Square, Union Square Market, Flare Alley, Silvercrest Observatory, Northwind Tower. \nThe Cobalt Market has overlapping signal areas with Quarry Point, Mosaic Plaza, Twilight Harbor, Primrose Boulevard, Azure Gardens, Brass Lantern Tavern, Horizon Mall, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Umbra Theater, Union Square Market, Riverstone Wharf, Flare Alley, Yarrow Plaza, Gilded Archway. \nThe Evergreen Circle has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza, Mosaic Plaza, Echo Station, Umbra Theater, Jade Fountain, Flare Alley, Northwind Tower. \nThe Quarry Point has overlapping signal areas with Quartz District, Granite Plaza, Primrose Boulevard, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Gilded Archway. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza, Twilight Harbor, Primrose Boulevard, Azure Gardens, Brass Lantern Tavern, Umbra Theater, Union Square Market, Skyline Gardens. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza, Twilight Harbor, Primrose Boulevard, Azure Gardens, Brass Lantern Tavern, Copper Clock Square, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Jade Fountain, Flare Alley, Silvercrest Observatory, Northwind Tower. \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Copper Clock Square, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Riverstone Wharf, Northwind Tower. \nThe Twilight Harbor has overlapping signal areas with Primrose Boulevard, Azure Gardens, Copper Clock Square, Silvercrest Observatory, Northwind Tower, Gilded Archway. \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station, Copper Clock Square, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Union Square Market, Riverstone Wharf, Flare Alley, Yarrow Plaza, Gilded Archway. \nThe Azure Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station, Copper Clock Square, Umbra Theater, Riverstone Wharf, Flare Alley, Gilded Archway. \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with Copper Clock Square, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Umbra Theater, Flare Alley, Silvercrest Observatory. \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with Horizon Mall, Copper Clock Square, Umbra Theater, Flare Alley, Yarrow Plaza, Silvercrest Observatory, Northwind Tower, Gilded Archway. \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Copper Clock Square, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Riverstone Wharf, Flare Alley, Yarrow Plaza, Skyline Gardens, Northwind Tower. \nThe Copper Clock Square has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater, Yarrow Plaza, Northwind Tower. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Union Square Market, Jade Fountain, Skyline Gardens. \nThe Umbra Theater has overlapping signal areas with Flare Alley, Yarrow Plaza, Northwind Tower. \nThe Union Square Market has overlapping signal areas with Jade Fountain, Silvercrest Observatory. \nThe Jade Fountain has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, Skyline Gardens, Gilded Archway. \nThe Riverstone Wharf has overlapping signal areas with Flare Alley, Yarrow Plaza, Skyline Gardens, Silvercrest Observatory, Northwind Tower. \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens, Gilded Archway. \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway. \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway. \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower. \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 25 major locations in the city: Echo Station, Lighthouse Point, Riverstone Wharf, Quarry Point, Copper Clock Square, Sapphire Arena, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Flint Forge Quarter, Granite Plaza, Opal Theater, King’s Row, Oakshade Library, Skyline Gardens, Gilded Archway, Westgate Station, Temple Square, Haven Docks, Quartz District, Brass Lantern Tavern, Jasper Marina, Zenith Arena, Primrose Boulevard, Duskwood Park, Velvet Corner and Yarrow Plaza. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with Quarry Point, Sapphire Arena, Granite Plaza, Opal Theater, Oakshade Library, Skyline Gardens, Westgate Station, Haven Docks, Yarrow Plaza. \nThe Lighthouse Point has overlapping signal areas with Riverstone Wharf, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Flint Forge Quarter, Opal Theater, Gilded Archway, Westgate Station, Quartz District, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Riverstone Wharf has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena, Opal Theater, King’s Row, Oakshade Library, Gilded Archway, Quartz District, Brass Lantern Tavern, Jasper Marina, Zenith Arena, Duskwood Park, Velvet Corner. \nThe Quarry Point has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena, Flint Forge Quarter, Granite Plaza, Opal Theater, King’s Row, Oakshade Library, Gilded Archway, Quartz District, Brass Lantern Tavern, Jasper Marina, Zenith Arena, Velvet Corner. \nThe Copper Clock Square has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater, King’s Row, Skyline Gardens, Westgate Station, Jasper Marina, Zenith Arena, Primrose Boulevard, Velvet Corner, Yarrow Plaza. \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral, Gilded Archway, Westgate Station, Quartz District, Brass Lantern Tavern, Zenith Arena, Duskwood Park, Yarrow Plaza. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater, Skyline Gardens, Gilded Archway, Temple Square, Jasper Marina, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater, King’s Row, Gilded Archway, Temple Square, Haven Docks, Quartz District, Brass Lantern Tavern, Jasper Marina, Primrose Boulevard, Duskwood Park, Velvet Corner. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Gilded Archway, Haven Docks, Jasper Marina, Zenith Arena, Duskwood Park. \nThe Opal Theater has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Skyline Gardens, Gilded Archway, Haven Docks, Quartz District, Duskwood Park. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens, Temple Square, Haven Docks, Quartz District, Jasper Marina, Primrose Boulevard, Yarrow Plaza. \nThe Oakshade Library has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway, Quartz District, Brass Lantern Tavern, Zenith Arena, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway, Haven Docks, Brass Lantern Tavern, Duskwood Park, Velvet Corner, Yarrow Plaza. \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Westgate Station, Jasper Marina, Primrose Boulevard, Velvet Corner, Yarrow Plaza. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Temple Square. \nThe Temple Square has overlapping signal areas with Haven Docks, Zenith Arena. \nThe Haven Docks has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina, Primrose Boulevard, Velvet Corner. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Zenith Arena. \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina, Zenith Arena, Primrose Boulevard, Velvet Corner. \nThe Zenith Arena has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park, Velvet Corner, Yarrow Plaza. \nThe Velvet Corner has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 25 major locations in the city: Yarrow Plaza, Cobalt Market, Union Square Market, Maplewood Conservatory, Echo Station, Sapphire Arena, Oakshade Library, Copper Clock Square, Brass Lantern Tavern, Ironbridge Crossing, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Evergreen Circle, Opal Theater, Moonlit Promenade, Velvet Corner, Northwind Tower, Knight’s Market, Haven Docks, Westgate Station, Nimbus Plaza, Quartz District, Mosaic Plaza, Horizon Mall, Willowshade Pavilion and Riverstone Wharf. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena, Oakshade Library, Copper Clock Square, Ironbridge Crossing, Evergreen Circle, Opal Theater, Knight’s Market, Haven Docks, Quartz District, Mosaic Plaza, Willowshade Pavilion, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Cobalt Market has overlapping signal areas with Maplewood Conservatory, Echo Station, Sapphire Arena, Oakshade Library, Brass Lantern Tavern, Evergreen Circle, Opal Theater, Moonlit Promenade, Velvet Corner, Westgate Station, Quartz District, Mosaic Plaza, Willowshade Pavilion. \nThe Union Square Market has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station, Oakshade Library, Brass Lantern Tavern, Velvet Corner, Northwind Tower, Knight’s Market, Mosaic Plaza, Willowshade Pavilion. \nThe Maplewood Conservatory has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station, Sapphire Arena, Copper Clock Square, Evergreen Circle, Opal Theater, Moonlit Promenade, Northwind Tower, Knight’s Market, Haven Docks, Horizon Mall, Willowshade Pavilion. \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena, Oakshade Library, Copper Clock Square, Brass Lantern Tavern, Ironbridge Crossing, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Moonlit Promenade, Knight’s Market, Haven Docks, Westgate Station, Nimbus Plaza, Mosaic Plaza. \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with Oakshade Library, Copper Clock Square, Knight’s Market, Westgate Station, Quartz District, Mosaic Plaza, Horizon Mall, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Oakshade Library has overlapping signal areas with Copper Clock Square, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Opal Theater, Northwind Tower, Haven Docks, Westgate Station, Mosaic Plaza, Horizon Mall, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Copper Clock Square has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Opal Theater, Moonlit Promenade, Haven Docks, Horizon Mall, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with Ironbridge Crossing, Evergreen Circle, Moonlit Promenade, Velvet Corner, Northwind Tower, Knight’s Market, Mosaic Plaza, Willowshade Pavilion. \nThe Ironbridge Crossing has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral, Evergreen Circle, Opal Theater, Moonlit Promenade, Northwind Tower, Horizon Mall. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Velvet Corner, Haven Docks, Nimbus Plaza, Quartz District, Mosaic Plaza. \nThe Evergreen Circle has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, Westgate Station, Horizon Mall, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Opal Theater has overlapping signal areas with Haven Docks, Willowshade Pavilion, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Moonlit Promenade has overlapping signal areas with Velvet Corner, Haven Docks, Mosaic Plaza, Willowshade Pavilion. \nThe Velvet Corner has overlapping signal areas with Haven Docks, Nimbus Plaza, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with Knight’s Market, Horizon Mall, Willowshade Pavilion, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Knight’s Market has overlapping signal areas with Quartz District, Mosaic Plaza, Horizon Mall. \nThe Haven Docks has overlapping signal areas with Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion. \nThe Nimbus Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Horizon Mall. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 25 major locations in the city: Quarry Point, Duskwood Park, Primrose Boulevard, Ironbridge Crossing, Lighthouse Point, Moonlit Promenade, Westgate Station, Amber Plaza, Mosaic Plaza, Haven Docks, Oakshade Library, Rosewood Hall, Azure Gardens, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Knight’s Market, Flare Alley, Brass Lantern Tavern, Lunar Pier, Beacon Tower, Skyline Gardens, Evergreen Circle, Velvet Corner, Maplewood Conservatory, Jasper Marina and Pennywhistle Arcade. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Quarry Point has overlapping signal areas with Primrose Boulevard, Moonlit Promenade, Mosaic Plaza, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Brass Lantern Tavern, Evergreen Circle, Velvet Corner, Maplewood Conservatory, Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Primrose Boulevard, Westgate Station, Haven Docks, Rosewood Hall, Beacon Tower, Maplewood Conservatory, Jasper Marina. \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with Lighthouse Point, Mosaic Plaza, Haven Docks, Rosewood Hall, Azure Gardens, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Brass Lantern Tavern, Lunar Pier, Velvet Corner, Jasper Marina, Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Ironbridge Crossing has overlapping signal areas with Westgate Station, Haven Docks, Oakshade Library, Knight’s Market, Brass Lantern Tavern, Beacon Tower, Evergreen Circle, Jasper Marina. \nThe Lighthouse Point has overlapping signal areas with Haven Docks, Oakshade Library, Rosewood Hall, Azure Gardens, Knight’s Market, Beacon Tower, Evergreen Circle, Maplewood Conservatory, Jasper Marina. \nThe Moonlit Promenade has overlapping signal areas with Westgate Station, Amber Plaza, Mosaic Plaza, Rosewood Hall, Skyline Gardens, Maplewood Conservatory, Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Oakshade Library, Rosewood Hall, Azure Gardens, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Skyline Gardens, Velvet Corner, Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Haven Docks, Rosewood Hall, Azure Gardens, Brass Lantern Tavern, Beacon Tower, Skyline Gardens, Evergreen Circle, Jasper Marina, Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Oakshade Library, Azure Gardens, Knight’s Market, Flare Alley, Velvet Corner, Maplewood Conservatory, Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Haven Docks has overlapping signal areas with Flare Alley, Brass Lantern Tavern, Lunar Pier, Velvet Corner, Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Oakshade Library has overlapping signal areas with Rosewood Hall, Azure Gardens, Knight’s Market, Flare Alley, Brass Lantern Tavern, Lunar Pier, Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Rosewood Hall has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral, Beacon Tower, Evergreen Circle, Velvet Corner, Jasper Marina, Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Azure Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral, Knight’s Market, Flare Alley, Beacon Tower, Velvet Corner, Jasper Marina, Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Lunar Pier, Beacon Tower. \nThe Knight’s Market has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Skyline Gardens, Velvet Corner, Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Velvet Corner, Jasper Marina. \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with Evergreen Circle, Maplewood Conservatory, Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Lunar Pier has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower, Evergreen Circle, Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with Velvet Corner, Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Maplewood Conservatory, Jasper Marina, Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Evergreen Circle has overlapping signal areas with Velvet Corner, Maplewood Conservatory, Jasper Marina, Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Velvet Corner has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina. \nThe Maplewood Conservatory has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 25 major locations in the city: Duskwood Park, Granite Plaza, Dragon’s Gate, Cobalt Market, Lighthouse Point, Yarrow Plaza, Skyline Gardens, Temple Square, Zenith Arena, Northwind Tower, Ironbridge Crossing, Copper Clock Square, Brass Lantern Tavern, Amber Plaza, Flint Forge Quarter, Jasper Marina, Rosewood Hall, Knight’s Market, Riverstone Wharf, Twilight Harbor, Moonlit Promenade, Primrose Boulevard, Shadowbridge Arcade, Mosaic Plaza and Haven Docks. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Cobalt Market, Lighthouse Point, Skyline Gardens, Northwind Tower, Ironbridge Crossing, Copper Clock Square, Brass Lantern Tavern, Amber Plaza, Jasper Marina, Rosewood Hall, Twilight Harbor, Moonlit Promenade, Shadowbridge Arcade, Mosaic Plaza, Haven Docks. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Lighthouse Point, Yarrow Plaza, Temple Square, Copper Clock Square, Brass Lantern Tavern, Amber Plaza, Flint Forge Quarter, Jasper Marina, Knight’s Market, Twilight Harbor, Mosaic Plaza. \nThe Dragon’s Gate has overlapping signal areas with Lighthouse Point, Zenith Arena, Ironbridge Crossing, Copper Clock Square, Brass Lantern Tavern, Amber Plaza, Jasper Marina, Shadowbridge Arcade, Mosaic Plaza. \nThe Cobalt Market has overlapping signal areas with Zenith Arena, Ironbridge Crossing, Copper Clock Square, Riverstone Wharf, Twilight Harbor, Mosaic Plaza, Haven Docks. \nThe Lighthouse Point has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Flint Forge Quarter, Rosewood Hall, Moonlit Promenade, Primrose Boulevard, Shadowbridge Arcade, Mosaic Plaza, Haven Docks. \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Temple Square, Ironbridge Crossing, Amber Plaza, Flint Forge Quarter, Rosewood Hall, Riverstone Wharf, Twilight Harbor, Moonlit Promenade, Primrose Boulevard, Haven Docks. \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, Ironbridge Crossing, Flint Forge Quarter, Jasper Marina, Primrose Boulevard, Shadowbridge Arcade. \nThe Temple Square has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Flint Forge Quarter, Rosewood Hall, Knight’s Market, Shadowbridge Arcade. \nThe Zenith Arena has overlapping signal areas with Copper Clock Square, Rosewood Hall, Riverstone Wharf, Shadowbridge Arcade, Mosaic Plaza, Haven Docks. \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Flint Forge Quarter, Knight’s Market, Shadowbridge Arcade. \nThe Ironbridge Crossing has overlapping signal areas with Copper Clock Square, Twilight Harbor, Mosaic Plaza. \nThe Copper Clock Square has overlapping signal areas with Amber Plaza, Jasper Marina, Knight’s Market, Primrose Boulevard, Mosaic Plaza. \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with Flint Forge Quarter, Jasper Marina, Riverstone Wharf, Primrose Boulevard, Haven Docks. \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina, Rosewood Hall, Knight’s Market, Twilight Harbor, Mosaic Plaza, Haven Docks. \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Knight’s Market, Primrose Boulevard, Shadowbridge Arcade, Mosaic Plaza. \nThe Jasper Marina has overlapping signal areas with Rosewood Hall, Knight’s Market, Twilight Harbor, Moonlit Promenade, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Rosewood Hall has overlapping signal areas with Knight’s Market, Twilight Harbor, Shadowbridge Arcade, Mosaic Plaza. \nThe Knight’s Market has overlapping signal areas with Twilight Harbor, Moonlit Promenade, Primrose Boulevard, Haven Docks. \nThe Riverstone Wharf has overlapping signal areas with Moonlit Promenade, Shadowbridge Arcade. \nThe Twilight Harbor has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade. \nThe Moonlit Promenade has overlapping signal areas with Primrose Boulevard, Haven Docks. \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade. \nThe Shadowbridge Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Haven Docks. \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Haven Docks. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 25 major locations in the city: Shadowbridge Arcade, Mosaic Plaza, Willowshade Pavilion, Brass Lantern Tavern, Temple Square, Amber Plaza, Oakshade Library, Dragon’s Gate, Moonlit Promenade, Echo Station, Ironbridge Crossing, Westgate Station, Opal Theater, Sapphire Arena, Pennywhistle Arcade, Quarry Point, Lighthouse Point, Velvet Corner, Knight’s Market, Haven Docks, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Evergreen Circle, Riverstone Wharf, Flint Forge Quarter and Beacon Tower. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Shadowbridge Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza, Temple Square, Oakshade Library, Moonlit Promenade, Sapphire Arena, Quarry Point, Knight’s Market, Haven Docks, Evergreen Circle, Riverstone Wharf, Beacon Tower. \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Amber Plaza, Oakshade Library, Dragon’s Gate, Echo Station, Westgate Station, Opal Theater, Lighthouse Point, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Evergreen Circle. \nThe Willowshade Pavilion has overlapping signal areas with Temple Square, Amber Plaza, Pennywhistle Arcade, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Beacon Tower. \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with Amber Plaza, Oakshade Library, Dragon’s Gate, Moonlit Promenade, Westgate Station, Opal Theater, Quarry Point, Velvet Corner, Evergreen Circle, Riverstone Wharf, Flint Forge Quarter, Beacon Tower. \nThe Temple Square has overlapping signal areas with Amber Plaza, Oakshade Library, Dragon’s Gate, Westgate Station, Opal Theater, Haven Docks, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Beacon Tower. \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Oakshade Library, Moonlit Promenade, Westgate Station, Opal Theater, Sapphire Arena, Pennywhistle Arcade, Velvet Corner, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Riverstone Wharf, Beacon Tower. \nThe Oakshade Library has overlapping signal areas with Dragon’s Gate, Moonlit Promenade, Echo Station, Ironbridge Crossing, Knight’s Market, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Dragon’s Gate has overlapping signal areas with Moonlit Promenade, Ironbridge Crossing, Westgate Station, Sapphire Arena, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Evergreen Circle, Flint Forge Quarter. \nThe Moonlit Promenade has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station, Ironbridge Crossing, Pennywhistle Arcade, Quarry Point, Lighthouse Point, Knight’s Market, Haven Docks, Evergreen Circle, Riverstone Wharf, Flint Forge Quarter. \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater, Pennywhistle Arcade, Knight’s Market, Riverstone Wharf, Flint Forge Quarter. \nThe Ironbridge Crossing has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena, Quarry Point, Lighthouse Point, Evergreen Circle, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater, Velvet Corner, Knight’s Market, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Riverstone Wharf, Flint Forge Quarter, Beacon Tower. \nThe Opal Theater has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena, Lighthouse Point, Haven Docks, Flint Forge Quarter, Beacon Tower. \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with Lighthouse Point, Knight’s Market, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Flint Forge Quarter, Beacon Tower. \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Lighthouse Point, Haven Docks, Riverstone Wharf, Flint Forge Quarter, Beacon Tower. \nThe Quarry Point has overlapping signal areas with Knight’s Market, Evergreen Circle, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Lighthouse Point has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral, Beacon Tower. \nThe Velvet Corner has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Knight’s Market has overlapping signal areas with Evergreen Circle, Flint Forge Quarter. \nThe Haven Docks has overlapping signal areas with Riverstone Wharf, Beacon Tower. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Evergreen Circle, Flint Forge Quarter. \nThe Riverstone Wharf has overlapping signal areas with Flint Forge Quarter. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 25 major locations in the city: Knight’s Market, Dragon’s Gate, Granite Plaza, Amber Plaza, Echo Station, Haven Docks, King’s Row, Lighthouse Point, Gilded Archway, Yarrow Plaza, Shadowbridge Arcade, Union Square Market, Flint Forge Quarter, Copper Clock Square, Northwind Tower, Nimbus Plaza, Skyline Gardens, Mosaic Plaza, Flare Alley, Primrose Boulevard, Velvet Corner, Pennywhistle Arcade, Riverstone Wharf, Cobalt Market and Azure Gardens. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Knight’s Market has overlapping signal areas with Amber Plaza, King’s Row, Yarrow Plaza, Shadowbridge Arcade, Union Square Market, Velvet Corner, Cobalt Market, Azure Gardens. \nThe Dragon’s Gate has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station, King’s Row, Gilded Archway, Yarrow Plaza, Skyline Gardens, Mosaic Plaza, Velvet Corner, Riverstone Wharf, Cobalt Market, Azure Gardens. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Amber Plaza, King’s Row, Gilded Archway, Yarrow Plaza, Copper Clock Square, Mosaic Plaza, Flare Alley, Azure Gardens. \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station, Gilded Archway, Yarrow Plaza, Nimbus Plaza, Skyline Gardens, Primrose Boulevard, Velvet Corner, Riverstone Wharf, Cobalt Market. \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with Haven Docks, King’s Row, Yarrow Plaza, Union Square Market, Flint Forge Quarter, Copper Clock Square, Nimbus Plaza, Flare Alley, Primrose Boulevard, Velvet Corner, Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Haven Docks has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade, Nimbus Plaza, Skyline Gardens, Flare Alley, Velvet Corner, Cobalt Market, Azure Gardens. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Lighthouse Point, Copper Clock Square, Northwind Tower, Nimbus Plaza, Mosaic Plaza, Primrose Boulevard, Cobalt Market, Azure Gardens. \nThe Lighthouse Point has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway, Yarrow Plaza, Shadowbridge Arcade, Nimbus Plaza, Skyline Gardens, Mosaic Plaza, Flare Alley, Pennywhistle Arcade, Cobalt Market, Azure Gardens. \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade, Flint Forge Quarter, Copper Clock Square, Northwind Tower, Flare Alley, Velvet Corner, Pennywhistle Arcade, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Flint Forge Quarter, Copper Clock Square, Northwind Tower, Nimbus Plaza, Flare Alley, Velvet Corner, Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Shadowbridge Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Flint Forge Quarter, Copper Clock Square, Skyline Gardens, Flare Alley, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Union Square Market has overlapping signal areas with Nimbus Plaza, Velvet Corner, Pennywhistle Arcade, Cobalt Market, Azure Gardens. \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza, Velvet Corner, Pennywhistle Arcade, Cobalt Market. \nThe Copper Clock Square has overlapping signal areas with Nimbus Plaza, Mosaic Plaza, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with Nimbus Plaza, Flare Alley, Primrose Boulevard, Riverstone Wharf, Azure Gardens. \nThe Nimbus Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Flare Alley, Velvet Corner, Riverstone Wharf, Cobalt Market, Azure Gardens. \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Velvet Corner, Pennywhistle Arcade, Azure Gardens. \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Primrose Boulevard, Azure Gardens. \nThe Velvet Corner has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade, Riverstone Wharf, Azure Gardens. \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Riverstone Wharf has overlapping signal areas with Cobalt Market, Azure Gardens. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 25 major locations in the city: Yarrow Plaza, Evergreen Circle, Sapphire Arena, Zenith Arena, Duskwood Park, Beacon Tower, Moonlit Promenade, Lunar Pier, Primrose Boulevard, Velvet Corner, Maplewood Conservatory, Jade Fountain, Pennywhistle Arcade, Knight’s Market, Flint Forge Quarter, Quarry Point, Quartz District, Skyline Gardens, Opal Theater, Umbra Theater, Gilded Archway, Horizon Mall, Amber Plaza, Union Square Market and Rosewood Hall. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park, Beacon Tower, Jade Fountain, Pennywhistle Arcade, Knight’s Market, Flint Forge Quarter, Quartz District, Umbra Theater, Gilded Archway, Rosewood Hall. \nThe Evergreen Circle has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park, Primrose Boulevard, Velvet Corner, Jade Fountain, Knight’s Market, Quarry Point, Quartz District, Opal Theater, Gilded Archway, Horizon Mall, Amber Plaza, Union Square Market, Rosewood Hall. \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with Zenith Arena, Duskwood Park, Primrose Boulevard, Pennywhistle Arcade, Knight’s Market, Flint Forge Quarter, Quarry Point, Quartz District, Skyline Gardens, Opal Theater, Gilded Archway, Union Square Market. \nThe Zenith Arena has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier, Maplewood Conservatory, Flint Forge Quarter, Gilded Archway, Union Square Market. \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower, Primrose Boulevard, Velvet Corner, Maplewood Conservatory, Pennywhistle Arcade, Flint Forge Quarter, Quarry Point, Gilded Archway, Amber Plaza. \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier, Flint Forge Quarter, Gilded Archway, Horizon Mall, Amber Plaza, Union Square Market. \nThe Moonlit Promenade has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier, Knight’s Market, Flint Forge Quarter, Opal Theater, Gilded Archway, Amber Plaza. \nThe Lunar Pier has overlapping signal areas with Velvet Corner, Jade Fountain, Knight’s Market, Flint Forge Quarter, Quartz District, Skyline Gardens, Opal Theater, Amber Plaza, Union Square Market. \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater, Umbra Theater, Horizon Mall, Rosewood Hall. \nThe Velvet Corner has overlapping signal areas with Maplewood Conservatory, Knight’s Market, Umbra Theater, Gilded Archway, Amber Plaza, Union Square Market. \nThe Maplewood Conservatory has overlapping signal areas with Jade Fountain, Flint Forge Quarter, Quarry Point, Umbra Theater, Gilded Archway, Horizon Mall, Union Square Market. \nThe Jade Fountain has overlapping signal areas with Knight’s Market, Flint Forge Quarter, Quarry Point, Skyline Gardens, Opal Theater, Gilded Archway, Amber Plaza. \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Flint Forge Quarter, Quarry Point, Opal Theater, Gilded Archway, Amber Plaza, Rosewood Hall. \nThe Knight’s Market has overlapping signal areas with Flint Forge Quarter, Quarry Point, Quartz District, Gilded Archway, Horizon Mall. \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Quarry Point, Skyline Gardens, Opal Theater, Umbra Theater, Union Square Market. \nThe Quarry Point has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater, Umbra Theater, Gilded Archway, Horizon Mall, Union Square Market. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater, Union Square Market. \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Union Square Market, Rosewood Hall. \nThe Opal Theater has overlapping signal areas with Rosewood Hall. \nThe Umbra Theater has overlapping signal areas with Horizon Mall, Rosewood Hall. \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Horizon Mall. \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Rosewood Hall. \nThe Union Square Market has overlapping signal areas with Rosewood Hall. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 25 major locations in the city: Duskwood Park, Union Square Market, Rosewood Hall, Shadowbridge Arcade, Pennywhistle Arcade, Primrose Boulevard, Northwind Tower, Mosaic Plaza, Zenith Arena, Velvet Corner, Umbra Theater, Granite Plaza, Quartz District, Brass Lantern Tavern, Sapphire Arena, Jasper Marina, Yarrow Plaza, King’s Row, Temple Square, Maplewood Conservatory, Twilight Harbor, Dragon’s Gate, Ironbridge Crossing, Nimbus Plaza and Silvercrest Observatory. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Rosewood Hall, Shadowbridge Arcade, Northwind Tower, Umbra Theater, Quartz District, Yarrow Plaza, Temple Square, Twilight Harbor, Dragon’s Gate, Ironbridge Crossing, Silvercrest Observatory. \nThe Union Square Market has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade, Primrose Boulevard, Northwind Tower, Zenith Arena, Umbra Theater, Sapphire Arena, Maplewood Conservatory, Dragon’s Gate, Ironbridge Crossing. \nThe Rosewood Hall has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade, Pennywhistle Arcade, Zenith Arena, Brass Lantern Tavern, King’s Row, Temple Square, Maplewood Conservatory, Twilight Harbor, Ironbridge Crossing, Nimbus Plaza. \nThe Shadowbridge Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade, Northwind Tower, Zenith Arena, Quartz District, Brass Lantern Tavern, Sapphire Arena, Maplewood Conservatory, Dragon’s Gate, Ironbridge Crossing, Nimbus Plaza. \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza, Velvet Corner, Sapphire Arena, Jasper Marina, Maplewood Conservatory, Twilight Harbor, Ironbridge Crossing, Nimbus Plaza. \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, Velvet Corner, Umbra Theater, Brass Lantern Tavern, Sapphire Arena, King’s Row, Maplewood Conservatory, Nimbus Plaza. \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater, Granite Plaza, Yarrow Plaza, Maplewood Conservatory, Ironbridge Crossing, Nimbus Plaza, Silvercrest Observatory. \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Ironbridge Crossing, Nimbus Plaza. \nThe Zenith Arena has overlapping signal areas with Velvet Corner, Granite Plaza, Temple Square, Maplewood Conservatory, Ironbridge Crossing, Silvercrest Observatory. \nThe Velvet Corner has overlapping signal areas with Quartz District, Brass Lantern Tavern, Jasper Marina, Yarrow Plaza, Temple Square, Maplewood Conservatory, Twilight Harbor, Dragon’s Gate. \nThe Umbra Theater has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza, Quartz District, Jasper Marina, Yarrow Plaza, King’s Row, Temple Square. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Jasper Marina, Temple Square. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Jasper Marina, Yarrow Plaza, King’s Row, Temple Square, Maplewood Conservatory, Dragon’s Gate, Silvercrest Observatory. \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina, Ironbridge Crossing, Nimbus Plaza, Silvercrest Observatory. \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina, Yarrow Plaza, King’s Row, Temple Square, Maplewood Conservatory, Twilight Harbor, Dragon’s Gate, Silvercrest Observatory. \nThe Jasper Marina has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, Twilight Harbor, Nimbus Plaza, Silvercrest Observatory. \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Maplewood Conservatory, Twilight Harbor, Dragon’s Gate, Ironbridge Crossing. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Twilight Harbor, Dragon’s Gate. \nThe Temple Square has overlapping signal areas with Maplewood Conservatory, Ironbridge Crossing, Nimbus Plaza, Silvercrest Observatory. \nThe Maplewood Conservatory has overlapping signal areas with Twilight Harbor, Dragon’s Gate, Ironbridge Crossing. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 25 major locations in the city: Duskwood Park, Oakshade Library, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Twilight Harbor, King’s Row, Flare Alley, Azure Gardens, Maplewood Conservatory, Westgate Station, Umbra Theater, Haven Docks, Northwind Tower, Silvercrest Observatory, Gilded Archway, Rosewood Hall, Evergreen Circle, Jasper Marina, Dragon’s Gate, Primrose Boulevard, Copper Clock Square, Horizon Mall, Sapphire Arena, Yarrow Plaza, Jade Fountain and Riverstone Wharf. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Oakshade Library, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Maplewood Conservatory, Umbra Theater, Haven Docks, Northwind Tower, Silvercrest Observatory, Evergreen Circle, Dragon’s Gate, Primrose Boulevard, Horizon Mall, Jade Fountain, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Oakshade Library has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral, Flare Alley, Azure Gardens, Maplewood Conservatory, Westgate Station, Northwind Tower, Silvercrest Observatory, Jasper Marina, Sapphire Arena, Yarrow Plaza, Jade Fountain, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Flare Alley, Azure Gardens, Maplewood Conservatory, Westgate Station, Haven Docks, Northwind Tower, Silvercrest Observatory, Evergreen Circle, Dragon’s Gate, Primrose Boulevard, Horizon Mall, Yarrow Plaza, Jade Fountain, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Twilight Harbor has overlapping signal areas with Haven Docks, Dragon’s Gate, Horizon Mall, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Flare Alley, Westgate Station, Umbra Theater, Haven Docks, Rosewood Hall, Evergreen Circle, Jasper Marina, Primrose Boulevard, Jade Fountain. \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Maplewood Conservatory, Umbra Theater, Silvercrest Observatory, Dragon’s Gate, Copper Clock Square, Horizon Mall. \nThe Azure Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, Jasper Marina, Horizon Mall, Sapphire Arena, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Maplewood Conservatory has overlapping signal areas with Haven Docks, Gilded Archway, Rosewood Hall, Evergreen Circle. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, Jasper Marina, Primrose Boulevard, Copper Clock Square, Sapphire Arena, Yarrow Plaza. \nThe Umbra Theater has overlapping signal areas with Haven Docks, Northwind Tower, Evergreen Circle, Copper Clock Square, Horizon Mall, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Haven Docks has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, Silvercrest Observatory, Gilded Archway, Rosewood Hall, Jasper Marina, Dragon’s Gate, Horizon Mall, Yarrow Plaza. \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway, Evergreen Circle, Jasper Marina, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina, Dragon’s Gate, Horizon Mall, Yarrow Plaza, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Rosewood Hall, Jasper Marina, Copper Clock Square, Horizon Mall, Yarrow Plaza. \nThe Rosewood Hall has overlapping signal areas with Evergreen Circle, Sapphire Arena, Jade Fountain. \nThe Evergreen Circle has overlapping signal areas with Copper Clock Square, Sapphire Arena, Yarrow Plaza, Jade Fountain. \nThe Jasper Marina has overlapping signal areas with Copper Clock Square, Sapphire Arena, Jade Fountain, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Dragon’s Gate has overlapping signal areas with Primrose Boulevard, Jade Fountain. \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Copper Clock Square has overlapping signal areas with Horizon Mall, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena, Yarrow Plaza, Jade Fountain. \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, Jade Fountain, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Jade Fountain has overlapping signal areas with Riverstone Wharf. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 25 major locations in the city: Granite Plaza, Union Square Market, Umbra Theater, Northwind Tower, Nimbus Plaza, Skyline Gardens, Gilded Archway, Willowshade Pavilion, Sapphire Arena, Mosaic Plaza, King’s Row, Ironbridge Crossing, Knight’s Market, Maplewood Conservatory, Pennywhistle Arcade, Rosewood Hall, Shadowbridge Arcade, Jasper Marina, Lighthouse Point, Twilight Harbor, Opal Theater, Velvet Corner, Temple Square, Westgate Station and Flint Forge Quarter. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Union Square Market, Northwind Tower, Skyline Gardens, Ironbridge Crossing, Maplewood Conservatory, Rosewood Hall, Twilight Harbor, Opal Theater, Temple Square, Westgate Station. \nThe Union Square Market has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, Nimbus Plaza, Gilded Archway, Willowshade Pavilion, Mosaic Plaza, Knight’s Market, Shadowbridge Arcade, Jasper Marina, Lighthouse Point, Twilight Harbor, Opal Theater, Velvet Corner, Temple Square, Westgate Station. \nThe Umbra Theater has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, Nimbus Plaza, Knight’s Market, Maplewood Conservatory, Rosewood Hall, Jasper Marina, Twilight Harbor, Opal Theater, Temple Square, Westgate Station, Flint Forge Quarter. \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens, Sapphire Arena, Mosaic Plaza, King’s Row, Maplewood Conservatory, Shadowbridge Arcade, Lighthouse Point, Twilight Harbor, Velvet Corner. \nThe Nimbus Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway, Knight’s Market, Maplewood Conservatory, Pennywhistle Arcade, Westgate Station. \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Sapphire Arena, Mosaic Plaza, King’s Row, Twilight Harbor. \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza, Pennywhistle Arcade, Shadowbridge Arcade, Jasper Marina, Lighthouse Point. \nThe Willowshade Pavilion has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Maplewood Conservatory, Pennywhistle Arcade, Rosewood Hall, Twilight Harbor, Opal Theater, Velvet Corner, Temple Square. \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Knight’s Market, Rosewood Hall, Jasper Marina, Lighthouse Point. \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Rosewood Hall, Shadowbridge Arcade, Lighthouse Point, Opal Theater, Velvet Corner, Temple Square. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Ironbridge Crossing, Pennywhistle Arcade, Velvet Corner, Westgate Station. \nThe Ironbridge Crossing has overlapping signal areas with Maplewood Conservatory, Pennywhistle Arcade, Shadowbridge Arcade, Velvet Corner, Westgate Station. \nThe Knight’s Market has overlapping signal areas with Rosewood Hall, Opal Theater, Velvet Corner, Temple Square, Westgate Station. \nThe Maplewood Conservatory has overlapping signal areas with Rosewood Hall, Twilight Harbor, Westgate Station. \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade, Twilight Harbor, Opal Theater, Temple Square, Westgate Station. \nThe Rosewood Hall has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade, Jasper Marina, Lighthouse Point, Velvet Corner, Westgate Station, Flint Forge Quarter. \nThe Shadowbridge Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Twilight Harbor, Opal Theater, Westgate Station. \nThe Jasper Marina has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater, Velvet Corner, Temple Square, Westgate Station, Flint Forge Quarter. \nThe Lighthouse Point has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater, Velvet Corner, Westgate Station. \nThe Twilight Harbor has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater, Temple Square, Westgate Station. \nThe Opal Theater has overlapping signal areas with Temple Square. \nThe Velvet Corner has overlapping signal areas with Westgate Station, Flint Forge Quarter. \nThe Temple Square has overlapping signal areas with Westgate Station. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 25 major locations in the city: Echo Station, Union Square Market, Azure Gardens, Haven Docks, Riverstone Wharf, Skyline Gardens, Horizon Mall, Mosaic Plaza, Twilight Harbor, Evergreen Circle, Duskwood Park, Copper Clock Square, Yarrow Plaza, Jasper Marina, Flint Forge Quarter, Shadowbridge Arcade, King’s Row, Lunar Pier, Brass Lantern Tavern, Dragon’s Gate, Opal Theater, Willowshade Pavilion, Primrose Boulevard, Jade Fountain and Quartz District. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with Union Square Market, Horizon Mall, Copper Clock Square, Jasper Marina, Brass Lantern Tavern, Opal Theater, Primrose Boulevard, Quartz District. \nThe Union Square Market has overlapping signal areas with Azure Gardens, Haven Docks, Mosaic Plaza, Twilight Harbor, Evergreen Circle, Duskwood Park, Flint Forge Quarter, Shadowbridge Arcade, Brass Lantern Tavern, Dragon’s Gate, Jade Fountain, Quartz District. \nThe Azure Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Haven Docks, Horizon Mall, Duskwood Park, Yarrow Plaza, Shadowbridge Arcade, King’s Row, Willowshade Pavilion, Primrose Boulevard, Jade Fountain, Quartz District. \nThe Haven Docks has overlapping signal areas with Twilight Harbor, Evergreen Circle, Duskwood Park, Yarrow Plaza, Flint Forge Quarter, Shadowbridge Arcade, Opal Theater, Willowshade Pavilion, Primrose Boulevard, Quartz District. \nThe Riverstone Wharf has overlapping signal areas with Evergreen Circle, Duskwood Park, Copper Clock Square, Yarrow Plaza, Jasper Marina, Flint Forge Quarter, Shadowbridge Arcade, King’s Row, Lunar Pier, Willowshade Pavilion, Quartz District. \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Opal Theater, Jade Fountain. \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza, Evergreen Circle, Duskwood Park, Copper Clock Square, Jasper Marina, Flint Forge Quarter, Dragon’s Gate, Opal Theater, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park, Shadowbridge Arcade, King’s Row, Lunar Pier, Brass Lantern Tavern, Primrose Boulevard, Jade Fountain, Quartz District. \nThe Twilight Harbor has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park, Jasper Marina, Flint Forge Quarter, Shadowbridge Arcade, King’s Row, Dragon’s Gate, Opal Theater, Willowshade Pavilion, Quartz District. \nThe Evergreen Circle has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park, Jasper Marina, Flint Forge Quarter, King’s Row, Opal Theater. \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina, Jade Fountain, Quartz District. \nThe Copper Clock Square has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, Flint Forge Quarter. \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Flint Forge Quarter, Shadowbridge Arcade, Lunar Pier, Brass Lantern Tavern, Dragon’s Gate, Willowshade Pavilion, Jade Fountain, Quartz District. \nThe Jasper Marina has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade, King’s Row, Dragon’s Gate, Jade Fountain, Quartz District. \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Primrose Boulevard, Quartz District. \nThe Shadowbridge Arcade has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Opal Theater, Willowshade Pavilion. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier, Jade Fountain, Quartz District. \nThe Lunar Pier has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater, Willowshade Pavilion, Primrose Boulevard, Quartz District. \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with Dragon’s Gate, Opal Theater, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Opal Theater has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Jade Fountain. \nThe Willowshade Pavilion has overlapping signal areas with Jade Fountain, Quartz District. \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with Quartz District. \nThe Jade Fountain has overlapping signal areas with Quartz District. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 25 major locations in the city: Northwind Tower, King’s Row, Jade Fountain, Echo Station, Skyline Gardens, Union Square Market, Quartz District, Evergreen Circle, Dragon’s Gate, Rosewood Hall, Riverstone Wharf, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Mosaic Plaza, Umbra Theater, Copper Clock Square, Yarrow Plaza, Velvet Corner, Temple Square, Willowshade Pavilion, Haven Docks, Oakshade Library, Brass Lantern Tavern, Granite Plaza, Lunar Pier and Moonlit Promenade. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Echo Station, Quartz District, Dragon’s Gate, Rosewood Hall, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Yarrow Plaza, Velvet Corner, Temple Square, Willowshade Pavilion, Lunar Pier, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Jade Fountain, Skyline Gardens, Union Square Market, Rosewood Hall, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Yarrow Plaza, Willowshade Pavilion, Oakshade Library, Brass Lantern Tavern, Granite Plaza, Lunar Pier. \nThe Jade Fountain has overlapping signal areas with Union Square Market, Quartz District, Evergreen Circle, Dragon’s Gate, Riverstone Wharf, Umbra Theater, Copper Clock Square, Temple Square, Willowshade Pavilion, Oakshade Library, Brass Lantern Tavern, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with Union Square Market, Rosewood Hall, Riverstone Wharf, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Umbra Theater, Yarrow Plaza, Temple Square, Oakshade Library, Lunar Pier. \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Union Square Market, Evergreen Circle, Riverstone Wharf, Mosaic Plaza, Umbra Theater, Copper Clock Square, Yarrow Plaza, Temple Square, Granite Plaza. \nThe Union Square Market has overlapping signal areas with Rosewood Hall, Copper Clock Square, Yarrow Plaza, Willowshade Pavilion, Haven Docks, Lunar Pier. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Dragon’s Gate, Rosewood Hall, Riverstone Wharf, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Copper Clock Square, Yarrow Plaza, Willowshade Pavilion, Lunar Pier. \nThe Evergreen Circle has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater, Copper Clock Square, Velvet Corner, Temple Square, Brass Lantern Tavern, Granite Plaza, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Dragon’s Gate has overlapping signal areas with Riverstone Wharf, Mosaic Plaza, Velvet Corner, Haven Docks, Brass Lantern Tavern, Lunar Pier. \nThe Rosewood Hall has overlapping signal areas with Riverstone Wharf, Copper Clock Square, Temple Square, Willowshade Pavilion, Haven Docks, Oakshade Library, Brass Lantern Tavern, Lunar Pier, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Riverstone Wharf has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza, Umbra Theater, Copper Clock Square, Yarrow Plaza, Oakshade Library. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza, Haven Docks, Granite Plaza, Lunar Pier, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion. \nThe Umbra Theater has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, Velvet Corner, Temple Square, Willowshade Pavilion, Oakshade Library, Brass Lantern Tavern, Lunar Pier, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Copper Clock Square has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, Velvet Corner, Willowshade Pavilion, Lunar Pier, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Velvet Corner, Temple Square, Oakshade Library, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Velvet Corner has overlapping signal areas with Oakshade Library. \nThe Temple Square has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza. \nThe Willowshade Pavilion has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Granite Plaza, Lunar Pier. \nThe Haven Docks has overlapping signal areas with Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Oakshade Library has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with Moonlit Promenade. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 25 major locations in the city: Ironbridge Crossing, Evergreen Circle, Copper Clock Square, Velvet Corner, Lunar Pier, Zenith Arena, Haven Docks, Northwind Tower, Nimbus Plaza, Cobalt Market, Lighthouse Point, Sapphire Arena, Amber Plaza, King’s Row, Beacon Tower, Knight’s Market, Flare Alley, Twilight Harbor, Yarrow Plaza, Jasper Marina, Dragon’s Gate, Silvercrest Observatory, Quarry Point, Quartz District and Oakshade Library. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Ironbridge Crossing has overlapping signal areas with Copper Clock Square, Velvet Corner, Haven Docks, Nimbus Plaza, Lighthouse Point, Sapphire Arena, Amber Plaza, King’s Row, Beacon Tower, Knight’s Market, Flare Alley, Twilight Harbor, Jasper Marina, Silvercrest Observatory, Quarry Point, Quartz District, Oakshade Library. \nThe Evergreen Circle has overlapping signal areas with Velvet Corner, Nimbus Plaza, Sapphire Arena, Amber Plaza, Beacon Tower, Knight’s Market, Flare Alley, Silvercrest Observatory, Quarry Point, Oakshade Library. \nThe Copper Clock Square has overlapping signal areas with Zenith Arena, Cobalt Market, Knight’s Market, Flare Alley, Twilight Harbor, Jasper Marina, Dragon’s Gate, Silvercrest Observatory, Oakshade Library. \nThe Velvet Corner has overlapping signal areas with Zenith Arena, Haven Docks, Nimbus Plaza, Sapphire Arena, Amber Plaza, Beacon Tower, Knight’s Market, Twilight Harbor, Jasper Marina, Dragon’s Gate, Silvercrest Observatory, Quarry Point, Oakshade Library. \nThe Lunar Pier has overlapping signal areas with Nimbus Plaza, Cobalt Market, Lighthouse Point, Twilight Harbor, Jasper Marina. \nThe Zenith Arena has overlapping signal areas with Haven Docks, Nimbus Plaza, Cobalt Market, Sapphire Arena, Amber Plaza, Beacon Tower, Twilight Harbor, Dragon’s Gate, Quartz District, Oakshade Library. \nThe Haven Docks has overlapping signal areas with Cobalt Market, Amber Plaza, Beacon Tower, Yarrow Plaza, Dragon’s Gate, Quarry Point, Quartz District, Oakshade Library. \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with Nimbus Plaza, Lighthouse Point, King’s Row, Knight’s Market, Yarrow Plaza, Dragon’s Gate, Silvercrest Observatory, Quarry Point, Oakshade Library. \nThe Nimbus Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Lighthouse Point, Flare Alley, Silvercrest Observatory, Quartz District. \nThe Cobalt Market has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower, Dragon’s Gate, Quartz District. \nThe Lighthouse Point has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena, King’s Row, Beacon Tower, Twilight Harbor, Yarrow Plaza, Dragon’s Gate. \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with Flare Alley, Twilight Harbor, Oakshade Library. \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower, Knight’s Market, Flare Alley, Yarrow Plaza, Quarry Point. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower, Knight’s Market, Jasper Marina, Oakshade Library. \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory. \nThe Knight’s Market has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, Jasper Marina, Dragon’s Gate, Oakshade Library. \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Twilight Harbor, Yarrow Plaza, Quartz District, Oakshade Library. \nThe Twilight Harbor has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, Dragon’s Gate, Quarry Point, Oakshade Library. \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina, Dragon’s Gate. \nThe Jasper Marina has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory, Quarry Point. \nThe Dragon’s Gate has overlapping signal areas with Quartz District. \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with Quarry Point. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 25 major locations in the city: Sapphire Arena, Jade Fountain, Northwind Tower, Riverstone Wharf, Silvercrest Observatory, Rosewood Hall, Mosaic Plaza, Flint Forge Quarter, Azure Gardens, Maplewood Conservatory, Zenith Arena, Duskwood Park, Shadowbridge Arcade, Lunar Pier, Haven Docks, Echo Station, Evergreen Circle, Flare Alley, Willowshade Pavilion, Beacon Tower, King’s Row, Union Square Market, Lighthouse Point, Jasper Marina and Horizon Mall. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with Jade Fountain, Riverstone Wharf, Flint Forge Quarter, Azure Gardens, Maplewood Conservatory, Zenith Arena, Duskwood Park, Lunar Pier, Flare Alley, Willowshade Pavilion, Horizon Mall. \nThe Jade Fountain has overlapping signal areas with Riverstone Wharf, Silvercrest Observatory, Rosewood Hall, Flint Forge Quarter, Azure Gardens, Maplewood Conservatory, Haven Docks, Evergreen Circle, Horizon Mall. \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with Rosewood Hall, Duskwood Park, King’s Row, Union Square Market, Lighthouse Point, Jasper Marina, Horizon Mall. \nThe Riverstone Wharf has overlapping signal areas with Azure Gardens, Lunar Pier, Echo Station, Evergreen Circle, Flare Alley, Jasper Marina, Horizon Mall. \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza, Flint Forge Quarter, Maplewood Conservatory, Duskwood Park, Shadowbridge Arcade, Evergreen Circle, Beacon Tower, Union Square Market. \nThe Rosewood Hall has overlapping signal areas with Azure Gardens, Zenith Arena, Lunar Pier, Echo Station, Evergreen Circle, Flare Alley, Willowshade Pavilion, Beacon Tower. \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Azure Gardens, Zenith Arena, Duskwood Park, Shadowbridge Arcade, Lunar Pier, Willowshade Pavilion, Jasper Marina, Horizon Mall. \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Zenith Arena, Shadowbridge Arcade, Lunar Pier, Haven Docks, Willowshade Pavilion, Beacon Tower, King’s Row, Union Square Market, Jasper Marina, Horizon Mall. \nThe Azure Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park, Evergreen Circle, Flare Alley, Beacon Tower, King’s Row, Lighthouse Point, Jasper Marina. \nThe Maplewood Conservatory has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park, Shadowbridge Arcade, Lunar Pier, Haven Docks, Evergreen Circle, Beacon Tower, King’s Row, Union Square Market, Jasper Marina. \nThe Zenith Arena has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station, Jasper Marina, Horizon Mall. \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station, Evergreen Circle, Willowshade Pavilion, King’s Row, Union Square Market, Horizon Mall. \nThe Shadowbridge Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier, Haven Docks, Evergreen Circle, Flare Alley, Willowshade Pavilion, Beacon Tower, Union Square Market, Jasper Marina. \nThe Lunar Pier has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station, Willowshade Pavilion, King’s Row, Union Square Market, Horizon Mall. \nThe Haven Docks has overlapping signal areas with Flare Alley, Willowshade Pavilion, Beacon Tower, King’s Row, Union Square Market. \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Jasper Marina. \nThe Evergreen Circle has overlapping signal areas with Flare Alley, Willowshade Pavilion, King’s Row, Horizon Mall. \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Beacon Tower, Lighthouse Point. \nThe Willowshade Pavilion has overlapping signal areas with Lighthouse Point, Jasper Marina. \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with Lighthouse Point, Jasper Marina. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Horizon Mall. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",
