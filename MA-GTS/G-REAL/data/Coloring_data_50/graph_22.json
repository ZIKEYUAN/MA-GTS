  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 22 major locations in the city: Lighthouse Point, Gilded Archway, Lunar Pier, Flare Alley, Brass Lantern Tavern, Union Square Market, Haven Docks, Sapphire Arena, Quartz District, Moonlit Promenade, Flint Forge Quarter, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Skyline Gardens, Opal Theater, Silvercrest Observatory, Duskwood Park, Echo Station, King’s Row, Velvet Corner, Granite Plaza, Horizon Mall and Maplewood Conservatory. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Lighthouse Point has overlapping signal areas with Flare Alley, Quartz District, Moonlit Promenade, Flint Forge Quarter, King’s Row. \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Flare Alley, Sapphire Arena, Quartz District, Moonlit Promenade, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Skyline Gardens, Opal Theater, Echo Station. \nThe Lunar Pier has overlapping signal areas with Flare Alley, Flint Forge Quarter, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Skyline Gardens, Silvercrest Observatory, Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Haven Docks, Quartz District, Moonlit Promenade, Silvercrest Observatory, Duskwood Park, Velvet Corner, Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with Moonlit Promenade, Flint Forge Quarter, Skyline Gardens, Opal Theater, Duskwood Park, Echo Station, Velvet Corner, Horizon Mall. \nThe Union Square Market has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena, Quartz District, Flint Forge Quarter, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Skyline Gardens, King’s Row, Velvet Corner, Horizon Mall. \nThe Haven Docks has overlapping signal areas with Moonlit Promenade, Skyline Gardens, Echo Station, Velvet Corner, Horizon Mall, Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral, Skyline Gardens, Silvercrest Observatory, Echo Station, Granite Plaza, Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral, Skyline Gardens, Silvercrest Observatory, Duskwood Park, Echo Station, Horizon Mall. \nThe Moonlit Promenade has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral, Duskwood Park, Echo Station, Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral, Opal Theater, King’s Row, Velvet Corner, Granite Plaza, Horizon Mall, Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens, Opal Theater, King’s Row, Horizon Mall, Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory, King’s Row, Velvet Corner, Granite Plaza, Horizon Mall, Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Opal Theater has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park, King’s Row, Granite Plaza. \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park. \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station, Granite Plaza, Horizon Mall. \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza, Horizon Mall, Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Velvet Corner has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza, Horizon Mall, Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Horizon Mall. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 22 major locations in the city: Northwind Tower, Sapphire Arena, Jade Fountain, Silvercrest Observatory, Ironbridge Crossing, Nimbus Plaza, Lighthouse Point, King’s Row, Maplewood Conservatory, Cobalt Market, Gilded Archway, Westgate Station, Evergreen Circle, Riverstone Wharf, Dragon’s Gate, Temple Square, Shadowbridge Arcade, Granite Plaza, Duskwood Park, Primrose Boulevard, Oakshade Library and Twilight Harbor. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with Lighthouse Point, King’s Row, Evergreen Circle, Riverstone Wharf, Temple Square, Duskwood Park, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with Jade Fountain, Ironbridge Crossing, Temple Square, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Jade Fountain has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory, Lighthouse Point, King’s Row, Cobalt Market, Gilded Archway, Evergreen Circle, Riverstone Wharf, Dragon’s Gate, Duskwood Park, Oakshade Library, Twilight Harbor. \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with Ironbridge Crossing, Lighthouse Point, Westgate Station, Evergreen Circle, Shadowbridge Arcade, Granite Plaza, Oakshade Library. \nThe Ironbridge Crossing has overlapping signal areas with Nimbus Plaza, Lighthouse Point, Shadowbridge Arcade, Granite Plaza, Oakshade Library, Twilight Harbor. \nThe Nimbus Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Lighthouse Point, Maplewood Conservatory, Gilded Archway, Westgate Station, Evergreen Circle, Riverstone Wharf, Dragon’s Gate, Temple Square, Shadowbridge Arcade, Duskwood Park, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Lighthouse Point has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Westgate Station, Evergreen Circle, Dragon’s Gate, Granite Plaza, Primrose Boulevard, Twilight Harbor. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway, Westgate Station, Dragon’s Gate, Granite Plaza. \nThe Maplewood Conservatory has overlapping signal areas with Riverstone Wharf, Shadowbridge Arcade, Granite Plaza, Primrose Boulevard, Oakshade Library. \nThe Cobalt Market has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway, Westgate Station, Dragon’s Gate, Temple Square, Shadowbridge Arcade, Duskwood Park, Primrose Boulevard, Oakshade Library. \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Riverstone Wharf, Primrose Boulevard, Twilight Harbor. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Dragon’s Gate, Shadowbridge Arcade, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Evergreen Circle has overlapping signal areas with Riverstone Wharf, Temple Square, Shadowbridge Arcade, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Riverstone Wharf has overlapping signal areas with Temple Square, Shadowbridge Arcade, Granite Plaza, Oakshade Library, Twilight Harbor. \nThe Dragon’s Gate has overlapping signal areas with Temple Square, Twilight Harbor. \nThe Temple Square has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Shadowbridge Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Oakshade Library. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park, Oakshade Library, Twilight Harbor. \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Oakshade Library, Twilight Harbor. \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with Oakshade Library. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 22 major locations in the city: Evergreen Circle, Temple Square, Quartz District, Nimbus Plaza, Silvercrest Observatory, Gilded Archway, Lunar Pier, Flint Forge Quarter, King’s Row, Yarrow Plaza, Zenith Arena, Cobalt Market, Knight’s Market, Copper Clock Square, Brass Lantern Tavern, Azure Gardens, Lighthouse Point, Northwind Tower, Primrose Boulevard, Pennywhistle Arcade, Horizon Mall and Quarry Point. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Evergreen Circle has overlapping signal areas with Temple Square, Nimbus Plaza, Silvercrest Observatory, Flint Forge Quarter, King’s Row, Yarrow Plaza, Azure Gardens, Lighthouse Point, Pennywhistle Arcade, Horizon Mall. \nThe Temple Square has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory, Gilded Archway, Zenith Arena, Cobalt Market, Brass Lantern Tavern, Azure Gardens, Primrose Boulevard, Quarry Point. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Nimbus Plaza, Silvercrest Observatory, Lunar Pier, Flint Forge Quarter, Cobalt Market, Knight’s Market, Brass Lantern Tavern, Azure Gardens, Pennywhistle Arcade, Horizon Mall. \nThe Nimbus Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory, Yarrow Plaza, Zenith Arena, Knight’s Market, Copper Clock Square, Northwind Tower, Quarry Point. \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway, Lunar Pier, Azure Gardens, Primrose Boulevard, Horizon Mall, Quarry Point. \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier, Flint Forge Quarter, Yarrow Plaza, Zenith Arena, Knight’s Market, Copper Clock Square, Brass Lantern Tavern, Lighthouse Point, Northwind Tower, Primrose Boulevard, Pennywhistle Arcade, Quarry Point. \nThe Lunar Pier has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Azure Gardens, Lighthouse Point, Northwind Tower. \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, Zenith Arena, Knight’s Market, Brass Lantern Tavern, Lighthouse Point, Horizon Mall. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, Cobalt Market, Knight’s Market, Copper Clock Square, Northwind Tower, Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Azure Gardens, Lighthouse Point, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Zenith Arena has overlapping signal areas with Knight’s Market, Brass Lantern Tavern, Pennywhistle Arcade, Horizon Mall, Quarry Point. \nThe Cobalt Market has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, Primrose Boulevard, Quarry Point. \nThe Knight’s Market has overlapping signal areas with Azure Gardens, Horizon Mall. \nThe Copper Clock Square has overlapping signal areas with Azure Gardens, Lighthouse Point, Northwind Tower, Pennywhistle Arcade, Horizon Mall. \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with Primrose Boulevard, Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Azure Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, Pennywhistle Arcade, Horizon Mall. \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with Horizon Mall, Quarry Point. \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Quarry Point. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 22 major locations in the city: Dragon’s Gate, Twilight Harbor, Flint Forge Quarter, Yarrow Plaza, Sapphire Arena, Duskwood Park, Silvercrest Observatory, Echo Station, Beacon Tower, Rosewood Hall, Northwind Tower, Copper Clock Square, Evergreen Circle, Skyline Gardens, Gilded Archway, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Quarry Point, Jasper Marina, Amber Plaza, Union Square Market, King’s Row and Zenith Arena. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Dragon’s Gate has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park, Echo Station, Rosewood Hall, Northwind Tower, Skyline Gardens, Gilded Archway, Union Square Market, King’s Row, Zenith Arena. \nThe Twilight Harbor has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, Sapphire Arena, Northwind Tower, Copper Clock Square, Evergreen Circle, Gilded Archway, Quarry Point, King’s Row. \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena, Skyline Gardens, Gilded Archway, Quarry Point, Jasper Marina. \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park, Silvercrest Observatory, Beacon Tower, Rosewood Hall, Northwind Tower, Copper Clock Square, Jasper Marina, Zenith Arena. \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with Rosewood Hall, Evergreen Circle, Gilded Archway, Quarry Point, Jasper Marina, Union Square Market, King’s Row, Zenith Arena. \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower, Rosewood Hall, Gilded Archway, Amber Plaza, Union Square Market, King’s Row, Zenith Arena. \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station, Beacon Tower, Northwind Tower, Quarry Point, King’s Row, Zenith Arena. \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with Quarry Point, Union Square Market. \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, Skyline Gardens, Gilded Archway, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Amber Plaza. \nThe Rosewood Hall has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, Evergreen Circle, Skyline Gardens, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Jasper Marina, Union Square Market. \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway, Amber Plaza, King’s Row. \nThe Copper Clock Square has overlapping signal areas with Evergreen Circle, Quarry Point, Jasper Marina, Amber Plaza, Union Square Market, King’s Row. \nThe Evergreen Circle has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens, Jasper Marina, Amber Plaza, Union Square Market, King’s Row. \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral, Amber Plaza, Union Square Market, King’s Row. \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Union Square Market. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina, Amber Plaza, Union Square Market, King’s Row. \nThe Quarry Point has overlapping signal areas with Amber Plaza, Union Square Market, King’s Row, Zenith Arena. \nThe Jasper Marina has overlapping signal areas with Amber Plaza, Union Square Market, King’s Row. \nThe Union Square Market has overlapping signal areas with Zenith Arena. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Zenith Arena. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 22 major locations in the city: Moonlit Promenade, Yarrow Plaza, Quarry Point, Pennywhistle Arcade, Beacon Tower, Granite Plaza, Dragon’s Gate, Copper Clock Square, Brass Lantern Tavern, Lighthouse Point, Evergreen Circle, Flint Forge Quarter, Willowshade Pavilion, Westgate Station, Echo Station, Quartz District, King’s Row, Lunar Pier, Shadowbridge Arcade, Skyline Gardens, Primrose Boulevard and Cobalt Market. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Moonlit Promenade has overlapping signal areas with Quarry Point, Pennywhistle Arcade, Willowshade Pavilion, Lunar Pier, Skyline Gardens, Cobalt Market. \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Quarry Point, Beacon Tower, Brass Lantern Tavern, Flint Forge Quarter, Westgate Station, Echo Station, Shadowbridge Arcade, Skyline Gardens. \nThe Quarry Point has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower, Granite Plaza, Brass Lantern Tavern, Lighthouse Point, Evergreen Circle, Flint Forge Quarter, Westgate Station, Echo Station, Quartz District, King’s Row, Lunar Pier, Shadowbridge Arcade, Skyline Gardens. \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower, Granite Plaza, Dragon’s Gate, Copper Clock Square, Brass Lantern Tavern, Willowshade Pavilion, Westgate Station, Echo Station, Lunar Pier, Skyline Gardens, Primrose Boulevard, Cobalt Market. \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza, Westgate Station, Quartz District, Cobalt Market. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Dragon’s Gate, Copper Clock Square, Quartz District, Cobalt Market. \nThe Dragon’s Gate has overlapping signal areas with Copper Clock Square, Brass Lantern Tavern, Flint Forge Quarter, Willowshade Pavilion, Lunar Pier, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Copper Clock Square has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Lighthouse Point, Westgate Station, Echo Station, Lunar Pier, Skyline Gardens, Cobalt Market. \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Quartz District, Skyline Gardens. \nThe Lighthouse Point has overlapping signal areas with Flint Forge Quarter, King’s Row, Lunar Pier, Shadowbridge Arcade, Skyline Gardens, Cobalt Market. \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Quartz District, King’s Row, Lunar Pier, Skyline Gardens, Primrose Boulevard, Cobalt Market. \nThe Willowshade Pavilion has overlapping signal areas with Westgate Station, Quartz District, King’s Row. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier, Shadowbridge Arcade, Primrose Boulevard, Cobalt Market. \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with Quartz District, King’s Row, Lunar Pier, Primrose Boulevard, Cobalt Market. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Skyline Gardens. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier, Shadowbridge Arcade. \nThe Lunar Pier has overlapping signal areas with Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Shadowbridge Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Primrose Boulevard, Cobalt Market. \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Primrose Boulevard. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 22 major locations in the city: Moonlit Promenade, Temple Square, Granite Plaza, Azure Gardens, Sapphire Arena, Jade Fountain, Mosaic Plaza, Ironbridge Crossing, Haven Docks, Union Square Market, Quartz District, Zenith Arena, Echo Station, Beacon Tower, Oakshade Library, Knight’s Market, Primrose Boulevard, Twilight Harbor, Nimbus Plaza, Pennywhistle Arcade, Copper Clock Square and Maplewood Conservatory. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Moonlit Promenade has overlapping signal areas with Azure Gardens, Sapphire Arena, Jade Fountain, Zenith Arena, Echo Station, Copper Clock Square, Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Temple Square has overlapping signal areas with Union Square Market, Beacon Tower, Primrose Boulevard, Nimbus Plaza, Pennywhistle Arcade, Copper Clock Square, Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena, Zenith Arena, Knight’s Market, Primrose Boulevard, Nimbus Plaza. \nThe Azure Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena, Mosaic Plaza, Ironbridge Crossing, Haven Docks, Zenith Arena, Echo Station, Knight’s Market, Primrose Boulevard, Nimbus Plaza, Pennywhistle Arcade, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with Jade Fountain, Mosaic Plaza, Oakshade Library, Pennywhistle Arcade, Copper Clock Square, Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Jade Fountain has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza, Haven Docks, Union Square Market, Zenith Arena, Echo Station, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Union Square Market, Beacon Tower, Twilight Harbor, Nimbus Plaza, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Ironbridge Crossing has overlapping signal areas with Quartz District, Zenith Arena, Beacon Tower, Knight’s Market, Twilight Harbor, Pennywhistle Arcade, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Haven Docks has overlapping signal areas with Union Square Market, Knight’s Market, Primrose Boulevard, Pennywhistle Arcade, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Union Square Market has overlapping signal areas with Quartz District, Beacon Tower, Oakshade Library, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Zenith Arena, Echo Station, Beacon Tower, Knight’s Market, Primrose Boulevard, Nimbus Plaza, Pennywhistle Arcade, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Zenith Arena has overlapping signal areas with Oakshade Library, Primrose Boulevard, Nimbus Plaza, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with Primrose Boulevard, Pennywhistle Arcade, Copper Clock Square, Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with Oakshade Library, Pennywhistle Arcade, Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Oakshade Library has overlapping signal areas with Primrose Boulevard, Twilight Harbor, Nimbus Plaza, Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Knight’s Market has overlapping signal areas with Nimbus Plaza, Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with Twilight Harbor, Nimbus Plaza, Copper Clock Square, Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Twilight Harbor has overlapping signal areas with Nimbus Plaza, Copper Clock Square, Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Nimbus Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 22 major locations in the city: Cobalt Market, Jade Fountain, Azure Gardens, Velvet Corner, Moonlit Promenade, Horizon Mall, Granite Plaza, Rosewood Hall, Shadowbridge Arcade, Knight’s Market, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Twilight Harbor, Silvercrest Observatory, Lighthouse Point, Pennywhistle Arcade, Duskwood Park, Yarrow Plaza, Temple Square, Brass Lantern Tavern, Amber Plaza, Riverstone Wharf and Ironbridge Crossing. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Cobalt Market has overlapping signal areas with Jade Fountain, Velvet Corner, Granite Plaza, Rosewood Hall, Shadowbridge Arcade, Knight’s Market, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Twilight Harbor, Lighthouse Point, Yarrow Plaza, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Jade Fountain has overlapping signal areas with Azure Gardens, Twilight Harbor, Brass Lantern Tavern, Amber Plaza, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Azure Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Velvet Corner, Moonlit Promenade, Rosewood Hall, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Silvercrest Observatory, Lighthouse Point, Amber Plaza, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Velvet Corner has overlapping signal areas with Moonlit Promenade, Rosewood Hall, Shadowbridge Arcade, Twilight Harbor, Lighthouse Point, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Moonlit Promenade has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza, Rosewood Hall, Shadowbridge Arcade, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Twilight Harbor, Silvercrest Observatory, Pennywhistle Arcade, Duskwood Park. \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Temple Square, Brass Lantern Tavern, Amber Plaza. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Rosewood Hall, Knight’s Market, Twilight Harbor, Lighthouse Point, Yarrow Plaza, Temple Square, Brass Lantern Tavern, Amber Plaza, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Rosewood Hall has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory, Duskwood Park, Brass Lantern Tavern, Amber Plaza, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Shadowbridge Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Knight’s Market, Temple Square, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Knight’s Market has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade, Duskwood Park, Yarrow Plaza, Amber Plaza. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade, Brass Lantern Tavern, Amber Plaza, Ironbridge Crossing. \nThe Twilight Harbor has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade, Yarrow Plaza, Temple Square, Brass Lantern Tavern, Ironbridge Crossing. \nThe Lighthouse Point has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade, Temple Square, Amber Plaza. \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park, Yarrow Plaza, Temple Square, Brass Lantern Tavern, Amber Plaza, Riverstone Wharf, Ironbridge Crossing. \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Temple Square, Brass Lantern Tavern, Riverstone Wharf, Ironbridge Crossing. \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Riverstone Wharf, Ironbridge Crossing. \nThe Temple Square has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Amber Plaza, Riverstone Wharf, Ironbridge Crossing. \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with Ironbridge Crossing. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 22 major locations in the city: Granite Plaza, Union Square Market, Mosaic Plaza, Opal Theater, Echo Station, Horizon Mall, Copper Clock Square, Azure Gardens, Moonlit Promenade, Twilight Harbor, Knight’s Market, Westgate Station, Silvercrest Observatory, Umbra Theater, Lighthouse Point, King’s Row, Quartz District, Jasper Marina, Willowshade Pavilion, Rosewood Hall, Dragon’s Gate and Riverstone Wharf. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Union Square Market, Mosaic Plaza, Opal Theater, Azure Gardens, Westgate Station, King’s Row, Jasper Marina, Willowshade Pavilion, Rosewood Hall. \nThe Union Square Market has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza, Echo Station, Twilight Harbor, Westgate Station, Silvercrest Observatory, Umbra Theater, Lighthouse Point, King’s Row. \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station, Horizon Mall, Copper Clock Square, Twilight Harbor, Westgate Station, Umbra Theater, Jasper Marina, Willowshade Pavilion, Rosewood Hall, Dragon’s Gate. \nThe Opal Theater has overlapping signal areas with Horizon Mall, Copper Clock Square, Moonlit Promenade, Umbra Theater, Lighthouse Point, Dragon’s Gate, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with Westgate Station, Umbra Theater, Jasper Marina, Dragon’s Gate, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Twilight Harbor, Lighthouse Point, Quartz District, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Copper Clock Square has overlapping signal areas with Moonlit Promenade, Silvercrest Observatory, Jasper Marina, Rosewood Hall. \nThe Azure Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Twilight Harbor, Knight’s Market, Westgate Station, Umbra Theater, Lighthouse Point, King’s Row, Willowshade Pavilion. \nThe Moonlit Promenade has overlapping signal areas with Twilight Harbor, Knight’s Market, Quartz District, Jasper Marina, Rosewood Hall, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Twilight Harbor has overlapping signal areas with Knight’s Market, Westgate Station, Umbra Theater, Lighthouse Point, King’s Row, Jasper Marina, Willowshade Pavilion, Rosewood Hall. \nThe Knight’s Market has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory, Lighthouse Point, Jasper Marina, Rosewood Hall. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater, Lighthouse Point, Jasper Marina. \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Quartz District, Rosewood Hall, Dragon’s Gate, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Umbra Theater has overlapping signal areas with Lighthouse Point, Quartz District, Jasper Marina. \nThe Lighthouse Point has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Rosewood Hall, Dragon’s Gate, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Quartz District, Willowshade Pavilion, Rosewood Hall. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Dragon’s Gate, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Jasper Marina has overlapping signal areas with Rosewood Hall, Dragon’s Gate. \nThe Rosewood Hall has overlapping signal areas with Dragon’s Gate. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 22 major locations in the city: Silvercrest Observatory, Primrose Boulevard, Oakshade Library, Willowshade Pavilion, Evergreen Circle, Duskwood Park, Flare Alley, Umbra Theater, Moonlit Promenade, Lunar Pier, Horizon Mall, Copper Clock Square, Granite Plaza, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Echo Station, Rosewood Hall, Union Square Market, Lighthouse Point, Riverstone Wharf, Yarrow Plaza, Cobalt Market and Temple Square. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with Evergreen Circle, Duskwood Park, Moonlit Promenade, Lunar Pier, Horizon Mall, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Echo Station, Yarrow Plaza, Cobalt Market, Temple Square. \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with Oakshade Library, Willowshade Pavilion, Duskwood Park, Flare Alley, Copper Clock Square, Granite Plaza, Echo Station, Yarrow Plaza, Cobalt Market. \nThe Oakshade Library has overlapping signal areas with Evergreen Circle, Duskwood Park, Umbra Theater, Lunar Pier, Horizon Mall, Granite Plaza, Riverstone Wharf, Temple Square. \nThe Willowshade Pavilion has overlapping signal areas with Moonlit Promenade, Lunar Pier, Granite Plaza, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Echo Station, Union Square Market, Lighthouse Point, Cobalt Market, Temple Square. \nThe Evergreen Circle has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park, Umbra Theater, Horizon Mall, Copper Clock Square, Granite Plaza, Lighthouse Point, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Flare Alley, Lunar Pier, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Echo Station, Rosewood Hall, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater, Moonlit Promenade, Lighthouse Point, Cobalt Market, Temple Square. \nThe Umbra Theater has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza, Riverstone Wharf, Yarrow Plaza, Cobalt Market, Temple Square. \nThe Moonlit Promenade has overlapping signal areas with Rosewood Hall, Lighthouse Point. \nThe Lunar Pier has overlapping signal areas with Horizon Mall, Copper Clock Square, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Echo Station, Union Square Market, Lighthouse Point, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza, Lighthouse Point, Cobalt Market. \nThe Copper Clock Square has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Rosewood Hall, Riverstone Wharf, Yarrow Plaza, Temple Square. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Rosewood Hall, Lighthouse Point, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station, Union Square Market, Lighthouse Point, Riverstone Wharf, Cobalt Market, Temple Square. \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with Riverstone Wharf, Temple Square. \nThe Rosewood Hall has overlapping signal areas with Union Square Market, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Union Square Market has overlapping signal areas with Riverstone Wharf, Cobalt Market. \nThe Lighthouse Point has overlapping signal areas with Riverstone Wharf, Yarrow Plaza. \nThe Riverstone Wharf has overlapping signal areas with Cobalt Market. \nThe Cobalt Market has overlapping signal areas with Temple Square. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 22 major locations in the city: Yarrow Plaza, Amber Plaza, Nimbus Plaza, Cobalt Market, Horizon Mall, Opal Theater, Zenith Arena, Mosaic Plaza, Shadowbridge Arcade, Echo Station, Haven Docks, Primrose Boulevard, Duskwood Park, Twilight Harbor, Beacon Tower, Lunar Pier, Union Square Market, Pennywhistle Arcade, Azure Gardens, Jasper Marina, Evergreen Circle and Moonlit Promenade. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Amber Plaza, Nimbus Plaza, Twilight Harbor, Lunar Pier, Jasper Marina, Evergreen Circle, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Nimbus Plaza, Horizon Mall, Haven Docks, Union Square Market, Evergreen Circle. \nThe Nimbus Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Zenith Arena, Twilight Harbor, Beacon Tower, Union Square Market, Pennywhistle Arcade, Azure Gardens. \nThe Cobalt Market has overlapping signal areas with Horizon Mall, Opal Theater, Zenith Arena, Mosaic Plaza, Shadowbridge Arcade, Twilight Harbor, Lunar Pier, Union Square Market, Jasper Marina, Evergreen Circle. \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza, Echo Station, Duskwood Park, Union Square Market, Pennywhistle Arcade, Jasper Marina, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Opal Theater has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station, Primrose Boulevard, Pennywhistle Arcade, Azure Gardens, Evergreen Circle, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Zenith Arena has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station, Haven Docks, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade, Primrose Boulevard, Duskwood Park, Lunar Pier, Union Square Market, Azure Gardens, Jasper Marina, Evergreen Circle. \nThe Shadowbridge Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station, Haven Docks, Lunar Pier, Union Square Market, Pennywhistle Arcade, Jasper Marina, Evergreen Circle, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower, Lunar Pier, Azure Gardens, Evergreen Circle, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Haven Docks has overlapping signal areas with Primrose Boulevard, Twilight Harbor, Lunar Pier, Union Square Market, Pennywhistle Arcade, Evergreen Circle, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with Twilight Harbor, Union Square Market, Azure Gardens, Jasper Marina, Evergreen Circle, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Twilight Harbor, Lunar Pier, Union Square Market, Jasper Marina, Evergreen Circle, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Twilight Harbor has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower, Pennywhistle Arcade, Evergreen Circle, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Lunar Pier has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade, Azure Gardens. \nThe Union Square Market has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina. \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Azure Gardens, Evergreen Circle. \nThe Evergreen Circle has overlapping signal areas with Moonlit Promenade. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 22 major locations in the city: Horizon Mall, Velvet Corner, Dragon’s Gate, Ironbridge Crossing, Westgate Station, Riverstone Wharf, Brass Lantern Tavern, Evergreen Circle, Skyline Gardens, Shadowbridge Arcade, Flint Forge Quarter, Granite Plaza, Willowshade Pavilion, Zenith Arena, Opal Theater, Moonlit Promenade, Nimbus Plaza, Flare Alley, Mosaic Plaza, Lunar Pier, Amber Plaza and Union Square Market. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Velvet Corner, Dragon’s Gate, Westgate Station, Skyline Gardens, Shadowbridge Arcade, Willowshade Pavilion, Zenith Arena, Opal Theater, Nimbus Plaza, Amber Plaza, Union Square Market. \nThe Velvet Corner has overlapping signal areas with Westgate Station, Skyline Gardens, Granite Plaza, Opal Theater, Moonlit Promenade, Flare Alley, Mosaic Plaza, Lunar Pier. \nThe Dragon’s Gate has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Evergreen Circle, Flint Forge Quarter, Zenith Arena, Nimbus Plaza, Flare Alley, Mosaic Plaza, Lunar Pier, Amber Plaza. \nThe Ironbridge Crossing has overlapping signal areas with Riverstone Wharf, Evergreen Circle, Skyline Gardens, Flint Forge Quarter, Granite Plaza, Opal Theater, Amber Plaza. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens, Shadowbridge Arcade, Granite Plaza, Willowshade Pavilion, Mosaic Plaza, Lunar Pier. \nThe Riverstone Wharf has overlapping signal areas with Evergreen Circle, Flint Forge Quarter, Granite Plaza, Opal Theater, Nimbus Plaza, Mosaic Plaza, Lunar Pier, Amber Plaza, Union Square Market. \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with Evergreen Circle, Skyline Gardens, Flint Forge Quarter. \nThe Evergreen Circle has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens, Shadowbridge Arcade, Moonlit Promenade, Mosaic Plaza, Amber Plaza, Union Square Market. \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza, Zenith Arena, Opal Theater, Nimbus Plaza, Flare Alley, Lunar Pier. \nThe Shadowbridge Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Moonlit Promenade, Nimbus Plaza, Flare Alley, Union Square Market. \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater, Moonlit Promenade, Flare Alley, Lunar Pier. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Zenith Arena, Opal Theater, Flare Alley, Amber Plaza. \nThe Willowshade Pavilion has overlapping signal areas with Zenith Arena, Opal Theater, Lunar Pier. \nThe Zenith Arena has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater, Nimbus Plaza, Mosaic Plaza, Amber Plaza. \nThe Opal Theater has overlapping signal areas with Flare Alley, Mosaic Plaza, Lunar Pier, Union Square Market. \nThe Nimbus Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Flare Alley, Mosaic Plaza, Amber Plaza, Union Square Market. \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier, Amber Plaza. \nThe Lunar Pier has overlapping signal areas with Union Square Market. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 22 major locations in the city: Yarrow Plaza, Beacon Tower, Union Square Market, Amber Plaza, Velvet Corner, Skyline Gardens, Nimbus Plaza, Gilded Archway, Copper Clock Square, Shadowbridge Arcade, Temple Square, Silvercrest Observatory, Granite Plaza, Oakshade Library, Northwind Tower, Lunar Pier, Zenith Arena, Umbra Theater, Quarry Point, Primrose Boulevard, Echo Station and Azure Gardens. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower, Nimbus Plaza, Gilded Archway, Shadowbridge Arcade, Silvercrest Observatory, Northwind Tower, Quarry Point, Primrose Boulevard, Echo Station, Azure Gardens. \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with Union Square Market, Gilded Archway, Copper Clock Square, Temple Square, Silvercrest Observatory, Lunar Pier, Umbra Theater, Quarry Point, Primrose Boulevard, Azure Gardens. \nThe Union Square Market has overlapping signal areas with Amber Plaza, Velvet Corner, Skyline Gardens, Nimbus Plaza, Shadowbridge Arcade, Silvercrest Observatory, Granite Plaza, Zenith Arena, Quarry Point, Azure Gardens. \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Velvet Corner, Shadowbridge Arcade, Oakshade Library, Lunar Pier, Zenith Arena, Quarry Point, Azure Gardens. \nThe Velvet Corner has overlapping signal areas with Copper Clock Square, Temple Square, Granite Plaza, Northwind Tower, Lunar Pier, Umbra Theater, Quarry Point, Echo Station, Azure Gardens. \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza, Oakshade Library. \nThe Nimbus Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Copper Clock Square, Granite Plaza, Oakshade Library, Northwind Tower, Umbra Theater, Primrose Boulevard, Echo Station, Azure Gardens. \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade, Granite Plaza, Northwind Tower, Lunar Pier, Zenith Arena, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Copper Clock Square has overlapping signal areas with Oakshade Library, Zenith Arena, Primrose Boulevard, Echo Station, Azure Gardens. \nThe Shadowbridge Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Temple Square, Umbra Theater, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Temple Square has overlapping signal areas with Oakshade Library, Zenith Arena, Echo Station. \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza, Lunar Pier, Umbra Theater, Azure Gardens. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Oakshade Library, Umbra Theater, Quarry Point, Primrose Boulevard, Echo Station. \nThe Oakshade Library has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, Lunar Pier, Zenith Arena, Umbra Theater, Primrose Boulevard, Echo Station. \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier, Zenith Arena. \nThe Lunar Pier has overlapping signal areas with Zenith Arena, Echo Station. \nThe Zenith Arena has overlapping signal areas with Azure Gardens. \nThe Umbra Theater has overlapping signal areas with Quarry Point. \nThe Quarry Point has overlapping signal areas with Azure Gardens. \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 22 major locations in the city: Moonlit Promenade, King’s Row, Amber Plaza, Horizon Mall, Union Square Market, Azure Gardens, Oakshade Library, Lunar Pier, Quarry Point, Nimbus Plaza, Opal Theater, Rosewood Hall, Knight’s Market, Pennywhistle Arcade, Granite Plaza, Jade Fountain, Temple Square, Northwind Tower, Silvercrest Observatory, Echo Station, Shadowbridge Arcade and Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Moonlit Promenade has overlapping signal areas with Horizon Mall, Union Square Market, Lunar Pier, Quarry Point, Pennywhistle Arcade, Silvercrest Observatory, Echo Station. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Amber Plaza, Opal Theater, Knight’s Market, Temple Square, Shadowbridge Arcade, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Union Square Market, Opal Theater, Knight’s Market, Shadowbridge Arcade, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Union Square Market, Quarry Point, Nimbus Plaza, Opal Theater, Rosewood Hall, Knight’s Market, Granite Plaza, Northwind Tower, Echo Station, Shadowbridge Arcade, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Union Square Market has overlapping signal areas with Azure Gardens, Opal Theater, Rosewood Hall, Pennywhistle Arcade, Jade Fountain, Echo Station. \nThe Azure Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier, Quarry Point, Opal Theater, Rosewood Hall, Pennywhistle Arcade, Granite Plaza, Jade Fountain, Northwind Tower, Shadowbridge Arcade. \nThe Oakshade Library has overlapping signal areas with Quarry Point, Temple Square, Silvercrest Observatory, Echo Station, Shadowbridge Arcade. \nThe Lunar Pier has overlapping signal areas with Quarry Point, Nimbus Plaza, Rosewood Hall, Knight’s Market, Pennywhistle Arcade, Jade Fountain, Temple Square, Echo Station, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Quarry Point has overlapping signal areas with Nimbus Plaza, Knight’s Market, Silvercrest Observatory, Echo Station, Shadowbridge Arcade, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Nimbus Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater, Temple Square, Northwind Tower, Silvercrest Observatory. \nThe Opal Theater has overlapping signal areas with Knight’s Market, Northwind Tower, Silvercrest Observatory, Echo Station, Shadowbridge Arcade, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Rosewood Hall has overlapping signal areas with Knight’s Market, Pennywhistle Arcade, Northwind Tower, Shadowbridge Arcade, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Knight’s Market has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza, Echo Station, Shadowbridge Arcade. \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Jade Fountain, Temple Square, Silvercrest Observatory. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station, Shadowbridge Arcade, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Jade Fountain has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory, Echo Station, Shadowbridge Arcade. \nThe Temple Square has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade. \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station. \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 22 major locations in the city: Umbra Theater, Temple Square, Knight’s Market, Quartz District, Lunar Pier, Evergreen Circle, Azure Gardens, Flint Forge Quarter, Jasper Marina, Flare Alley, Pennywhistle Arcade, Haven Docks, Amber Plaza, Quarry Point, King’s Row, Opal Theater, Gilded Archway, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Willowshade Pavilion, Sapphire Arena, Primrose Boulevard and Lighthouse Point. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Umbra Theater has overlapping signal areas with Temple Square, Knight’s Market, Quartz District, Haven Docks, Opal Theater, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Sapphire Arena. \nThe Temple Square has overlapping signal areas with Knight’s Market, Azure Gardens, King’s Row, Opal Theater. \nThe Knight’s Market has overlapping signal areas with Evergreen Circle, Flint Forge Quarter, Jasper Marina, Flare Alley, Haven Docks, Amber Plaza, Gilded Archway, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Willowshade Pavilion, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier, Azure Gardens, Flint Forge Quarter, Flare Alley, Pennywhistle Arcade, Haven Docks, Willowshade Pavilion, Sapphire Arena, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Lunar Pier has overlapping signal areas with Evergreen Circle, Azure Gardens, Flare Alley, Pennywhistle Arcade, Haven Docks, King’s Row, Opal Theater, Gilded Archway, Willowshade Pavilion, Sapphire Arena. \nThe Evergreen Circle has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina, Flare Alley, Quarry Point, King’s Row, Primrose Boulevard, Lighthouse Point. \nThe Azure Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina, Pennywhistle Arcade, Quarry Point, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Flare Alley, Haven Docks, Opal Theater, Willowshade Pavilion, Sapphire Arena, Primrose Boulevard, Lighthouse Point. \nThe Jasper Marina has overlapping signal areas with Flare Alley, Pennywhistle Arcade, Haven Docks, Amber Plaza, King’s Row, Sapphire Arena, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade, Haven Docks, Amber Plaza, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Primrose Boulevard, Lighthouse Point. \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Haven Docks, King’s Row, Opal Theater, Gilded Archway, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Sapphire Arena. \nThe Haven Docks has overlapping signal areas with Amber Plaza, King’s Row, Gilded Archway, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Quarry Point, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Quarry Point has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Willowshade Pavilion, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral, Willowshade Pavilion, Sapphire Arena. \nThe Opal Theater has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena, Primrose Boulevard, Lighthouse Point. \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Primrose Boulevard, Lighthouse Point. \nThe Willowshade Pavilion has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena. \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with Lighthouse Point. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 22 major locations in the city: Azure Gardens, Amber Plaza, Mosaic Plaza, Skyline Gardens, Ironbridge Crossing, Primrose Boulevard, Flare Alley, Moonlit Promenade, Quartz District, Willowshade Pavilion, Pennywhistle Arcade, Jade Fountain, Zenith Arena, Union Square Market, Temple Square, Copper Clock Square, King’s Row, Westgate Station, Twilight Harbor, Lighthouse Point, Yarrow Plaza and Cobalt Market. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Azure Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Amber Plaza, Ironbridge Crossing, Zenith Arena, Union Square Market, Copper Clock Square, Westgate Station, Twilight Harbor, Lighthouse Point, Yarrow Plaza, Cobalt Market. \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza, Ironbridge Crossing, Primrose Boulevard, Flare Alley, Moonlit Promenade, Quartz District, Willowshade Pavilion, Zenith Arena, Union Square Market, Temple Square, Copper Clock Square, Twilight Harbor, Yarrow Plaza, Cobalt Market. \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Ironbridge Crossing, Primrose Boulevard, Flare Alley, Quartz District, Pennywhistle Arcade, Jade Fountain, Zenith Arena, Temple Square, Westgate Station, Twilight Harbor, Lighthouse Point, Yarrow Plaza. \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Flare Alley, Moonlit Promenade, Quartz District, Pennywhistle Arcade, Zenith Arena, Copper Clock Square, King’s Row, Twilight Harbor, Yarrow Plaza, Cobalt Market. \nThe Ironbridge Crossing has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade, King’s Row, Yarrow Plaza. \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with Moonlit Promenade, Willowshade Pavilion, Pennywhistle Arcade, Westgate Station, Twilight Harbor, Cobalt Market. \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Moonlit Promenade, Quartz District, Twilight Harbor, Cobalt Market. \nThe Moonlit Promenade has overlapping signal areas with Quartz District, Zenith Arena, Temple Square, Copper Clock Square, Westgate Station, Lighthouse Point. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Jade Fountain, Copper Clock Square, King’s Row, Westgate Station, Twilight Harbor, Cobalt Market. \nThe Willowshade Pavilion has overlapping signal areas with Copper Clock Square, Yarrow Plaza, Cobalt Market. \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Jade Fountain, Union Square Market, Copper Clock Square, Westgate Station, Lighthouse Point. \nThe Jade Fountain has overlapping signal areas with Temple Square, Twilight Harbor, Lighthouse Point. \nThe Zenith Arena has overlapping signal areas with Copper Clock Square, King’s Row, Westgate Station, Yarrow Plaza. \nThe Union Square Market has overlapping signal areas with Cobalt Market. \nThe Temple Square has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Twilight Harbor. \nThe Copper Clock Square has overlapping signal areas with Westgate Station. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Lighthouse Point, Cobalt Market. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Twilight Harbor. \nThe Twilight Harbor has overlapping signal areas with Lighthouse Point. \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Cobalt Market. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 22 major locations in the city: Ivory Spire Cathedral, Echo Station, Umbra Theater, Ironbridge Crossing, Lunar Pier, Flint Forge Quarter, Shadowbridge Arcade, Oakshade Library, Northwind Tower, Beacon Tower, Mosaic Plaza, Primrose Boulevard, Sapphire Arena, Brass Lantern Tavern, Quarry Point, King’s Row, Velvet Corner, Flare Alley, Riverstone Wharf, Copper Clock Square, Evergreen Circle and Haven Docks. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Ironbridge Crossing, Beacon Tower, Mosaic Plaza, Sapphire Arena, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower, Primrose Boulevard, Sapphire Arena, Brass Lantern Tavern, Quarry Point, Velvet Corner, Flare Alley, Haven Docks. \nThe Umbra Theater has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier, Flint Forge Quarter, Primrose Boulevard, King’s Row, Velvet Corner, Copper Clock Square, Evergreen Circle, Haven Docks. \nThe Ironbridge Crossing has overlapping signal areas with Oakshade Library, Northwind Tower, Primrose Boulevard, Brass Lantern Tavern, Velvet Corner, Flare Alley, Evergreen Circle. \nThe Lunar Pier has overlapping signal areas with Flint Forge Quarter, Mosaic Plaza, Sapphire Arena, King’s Row, Copper Clock Square, Evergreen Circle, Haven Docks. \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade, Oakshade Library, Northwind Tower, Beacon Tower, Primrose Boulevard, Sapphire Arena, Brass Lantern Tavern, Quarry Point. \nThe Shadowbridge Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza, Brass Lantern Tavern, King’s Row, Riverstone Wharf, Evergreen Circle, Haven Docks. \nThe Oakshade Library has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, Beacon Tower, Riverstone Wharf, Evergreen Circle. \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena, Brass Lantern Tavern, Flare Alley, Riverstone Wharf, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza, Sapphire Arena, Brass Lantern Tavern, King’s Row, Flare Alley, Riverstone Wharf, Copper Clock Square, Evergreen Circle, Haven Docks. \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena, King’s Row, Riverstone Wharf, Evergreen Circle. \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Velvet Corner. \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with Velvet Corner, Copper Clock Square, Evergreen Circle. \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with Flare Alley, Riverstone Wharf, Copper Clock Square, Haven Docks. \nThe Quarry Point has overlapping signal areas with Velvet Corner, Flare Alley, Evergreen Circle. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Velvet Corner, Flare Alley, Evergreen Circle, Haven Docks. \nThe Velvet Corner has overlapping signal areas with Flare Alley, Evergreen Circle, Haven Docks. \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Copper Clock Square, Evergreen Circle, Haven Docks. \nThe Riverstone Wharf has overlapping signal areas with Copper Clock Square, Evergreen Circle. \nThe Evergreen Circle has overlapping signal areas with Haven Docks. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 22 major locations in the city: Westgate Station, Dragon’s Gate, Primrose Boulevard, Lunar Pier, King’s Row, Willowshade Pavilion, Skyline Gardens, Amber Plaza, Umbra Theater, Nimbus Plaza, Zenith Arena, Maplewood Conservatory, Lighthouse Point, Duskwood Park, Moonlit Promenade, Pennywhistle Arcade, Opal Theater, Flint Forge Quarter, Knight’s Market, Yarrow Plaza, Velvet Corner and Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Zenith Arena, Opal Theater, Yarrow Plaza, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Dragon’s Gate has overlapping signal areas with Primrose Boulevard, Lunar Pier, Skyline Gardens, Amber Plaza, Nimbus Plaza, Maplewood Conservatory, Duskwood Park, Pennywhistle Arcade, Opal Theater, Yarrow Plaza. \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier, King’s Row, Willowshade Pavilion, Skyline Gardens, Umbra Theater, Maplewood Conservatory, Pennywhistle Arcade, Knight’s Market, Yarrow Plaza, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Lunar Pier has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Skyline Gardens, Amber Plaza, Moonlit Promenade, Yarrow Plaza. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Amber Plaza, Nimbus Plaza, Flint Forge Quarter, Knight’s Market. \nThe Willowshade Pavilion has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens, Nimbus Plaza, Zenith Arena, Maplewood Conservatory, Lighthouse Point, Flint Forge Quarter, Knight’s Market, Yarrow Plaza, Velvet Corner. \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Amber Plaza, Umbra Theater, Nimbus Plaza, Zenith Arena, Pennywhistle Arcade, Opal Theater, Flint Forge Quarter, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater, Maplewood Conservatory, Moonlit Promenade, Pennywhistle Arcade, Knight’s Market, Velvet Corner. \nThe Umbra Theater has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade, Opal Theater, Knight’s Market, Yarrow Plaza, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Nimbus Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Lighthouse Point. \nThe Zenith Arena has overlapping signal areas with Flint Forge Quarter, Yarrow Plaza, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Maplewood Conservatory has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park, Pennywhistle Arcade, Opal Theater, Yarrow Plaza, Velvet Corner, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Lighthouse Point has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park, Opal Theater, Flint Forge Quarter, Knight’s Market, Yarrow Plaza, Velvet Corner, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Moonlit Promenade, Pennywhistle Arcade, Opal Theater, Flint Forge Quarter, Velvet Corner, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Moonlit Promenade has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade, Opal Theater, Flint Forge Quarter. \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater, Knight’s Market, Velvet Corner. \nThe Opal Theater has overlapping signal areas with Knight’s Market. \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Knight’s Market, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Knight’s Market has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza. \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Velvet Corner. \nThe Velvet Corner has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 22 major locations in the city: Rosewood Hall, Granite Plaza, Ironbridge Crossing, Mosaic Plaza, Dragon’s Gate, Evergreen Circle, Copper Clock Square, Flare Alley, Temple Square, Pennywhistle Arcade, Jasper Marina, Quarry Point, Maplewood Conservatory, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Quartz District, Cobalt Market, King’s Row, Beacon Tower, Jade Fountain, Azure Gardens, Flint Forge Quarter and Horizon Mall. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Rosewood Hall has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza, Mosaic Plaza, Flare Alley, Temple Square, Quarry Point, Maplewood Conservatory, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Cobalt Market, Beacon Tower, Horizon Mall. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Ironbridge Crossing, Mosaic Plaza, Evergreen Circle, Flare Alley, Temple Square, Pennywhistle Arcade, Jasper Marina, Quarry Point, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Azure Gardens. \nThe Ironbridge Crossing has overlapping signal areas with Dragon’s Gate, Copper Clock Square, Maplewood Conservatory, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Beacon Tower, Azure Gardens. \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Copper Clock Square, Jasper Marina, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Quartz District, Azure Gardens. \nThe Dragon’s Gate has overlapping signal areas with Temple Square, Quarry Point, Maplewood Conservatory, King’s Row, Beacon Tower, Jade Fountain, Azure Gardens, Flint Forge Quarter. \nThe Evergreen Circle has overlapping signal areas with Copper Clock Square, Temple Square, Quarry Point, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Horizon Mall. \nThe Copper Clock Square has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade, Quartz District, Jade Fountain, Azure Gardens, Flint Forge Quarter. \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina, Quarry Point, King’s Row, Beacon Tower, Jade Fountain, Azure Gardens, Flint Forge Quarter. \nThe Temple Square has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina, Quartz District, Cobalt Market, King’s Row, Azure Gardens, Flint Forge Quarter. \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina, Quarry Point, Maplewood Conservatory, Quartz District, Beacon Tower, Azure Gardens, Horizon Mall. \nThe Jasper Marina has overlapping signal areas with Maplewood Conservatory, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Cobalt Market, King’s Row, Jade Fountain, Azure Gardens, Horizon Mall. \nThe Quarry Point has overlapping signal areas with Maplewood Conservatory, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Quartz District, Cobalt Market, Beacon Tower, Horizon Mall. \nThe Maplewood Conservatory has overlapping signal areas with Cobalt Market, Jade Fountain, Flint Forge Quarter, Horizon Mall. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Cobalt Market, Flint Forge Quarter. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Cobalt Market, King’s Row, Jade Fountain, Horizon Mall. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Jade Fountain, Flint Forge Quarter. \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with Jade Fountain. \nThe Azure Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Horizon Mall. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 22 major locations in the city: Pennywhistle Arcade, Nimbus Plaza, Amber Plaza, Dragon’s Gate, Westgate Station, King’s Row, Zenith Arena, Umbra Theater, Gilded Archway, Ironbridge Crossing, Northwind Tower, Evergreen Circle, Union Square Market, Moonlit Promenade, Beacon Tower, Quartz District, Granite Plaza, Maplewood Conservatory, Quarry Point, Flare Alley, Yarrow Plaza and Skyline Gardens. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Amber Plaza, Dragon’s Gate, Gilded Archway, Beacon Tower, Maplewood Conservatory, Flare Alley, Yarrow Plaza, Skyline Gardens. \nThe Nimbus Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, Evergreen Circle, Union Square Market, Beacon Tower, Quartz District, Granite Plaza, Yarrow Plaza, Skyline Gardens. \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Dragon’s Gate, Westgate Station, King’s Row, Gilded Archway, Union Square Market, Beacon Tower, Granite Plaza, Maplewood Conservatory, Flare Alley. \nThe Dragon’s Gate has overlapping signal areas with Westgate Station, King’s Row, Gilded Archway, Ironbridge Crossing, Northwind Tower, Moonlit Promenade, Yarrow Plaza. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Gilded Archway, Evergreen Circle, Quartz District, Granite Plaza, Flare Alley, Skyline Gardens. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Zenith Arena, Beacon Tower, Quartz District, Quarry Point, Flare Alley, Yarrow Plaza, Skyline Gardens. \nThe Zenith Arena has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater, Northwind Tower, Evergreen Circle, Beacon Tower, Quarry Point, Yarrow Plaza, Skyline Gardens. \nThe Umbra Theater has overlapping signal areas with Ironbridge Crossing, Moonlit Promenade, Beacon Tower, Quartz District, Maplewood Conservatory, Quarry Point, Yarrow Plaza, Skyline Gardens. \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, Evergreen Circle, Moonlit Promenade, Quartz District, Quarry Point, Yarrow Plaza. \nThe Ironbridge Crossing has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, Evergreen Circle, Union Square Market, Granite Plaza. \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with Evergreen Circle, Union Square Market, Moonlit Promenade, Beacon Tower, Quarry Point, Flare Alley, Yarrow Plaza. \nThe Evergreen Circle has overlapping signal areas with Union Square Market, Moonlit Promenade, Quarry Point, Yarrow Plaza. \nThe Union Square Market has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower, Quartz District, Skyline Gardens. \nThe Moonlit Promenade has overlapping signal areas with Quarry Point, Flare Alley, Skyline Gardens. \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with Quartz District, Granite Plaza, Quarry Point, Flare Alley, Yarrow Plaza. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Flare Alley. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens. \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 22 major locations in the city: Beacon Tower, Evergreen Circle, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Temple Square, Zenith Arena, Skyline Gardens, Yarrow Plaza, Amber Plaza, Opal Theater, Cobalt Market, Granite Plaza, Pennywhistle Arcade, Silvercrest Observatory, Lunar Pier, Union Square Market, Velvet Corner, Moonlit Promenade, Nimbus Plaza, Twilight Harbor, Flint Forge Quarter, Oakshade Library and Jasper Marina. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with Temple Square, Zenith Arena, Skyline Gardens, Yarrow Plaza, Amber Plaza, Opal Theater, Moonlit Promenade, Nimbus Plaza, Twilight Harbor, Flint Forge Quarter, Jasper Marina. \nThe Evergreen Circle has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral, Temple Square, Zenith Arena, Opal Theater, Lunar Pier, Nimbus Plaza, Twilight Harbor, Jasper Marina. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, Amber Plaza, Cobalt Market, Granite Plaza, Silvercrest Observatory, Lunar Pier, Velvet Corner, Nimbus Plaza, Flint Forge Quarter. \nThe Temple Square has overlapping signal areas with Zenith Arena, Silvercrest Observatory, Lunar Pier, Union Square Market, Twilight Harbor, Flint Forge Quarter, Oakshade Library. \nThe Zenith Arena has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens, Amber Plaza, Opal Theater, Union Square Market, Moonlit Promenade, Flint Forge Quarter, Oakshade Library, Jasper Marina. \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, Nimbus Plaza, Twilight Harbor. \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Cobalt Market, Silvercrest Observatory, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater, Cobalt Market, Granite Plaza, Pennywhistle Arcade, Silvercrest Observatory, Lunar Pier, Moonlit Promenade, Nimbus Plaza, Oakshade Library. \nThe Opal Theater has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza, Pennywhistle Arcade, Velvet Corner, Twilight Harbor, Flint Forge Quarter, Oakshade Library, Jasper Marina. \nThe Cobalt Market has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza, Pennywhistle Arcade, Silvercrest Observatory, Lunar Pier, Velvet Corner, Moonlit Promenade, Nimbus Plaza, Twilight Harbor, Oakshade Library. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory, Flint Forge Quarter, Jasper Marina. \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Velvet Corner, Moonlit Promenade, Flint Forge Quarter, Jasper Marina. \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier, Nimbus Plaza, Oakshade Library, Jasper Marina. \nThe Lunar Pier has overlapping signal areas with Twilight Harbor. \nThe Union Square Market has overlapping signal areas with Nimbus Plaza. \nThe Velvet Corner has overlapping signal areas with Twilight Harbor, Jasper Marina. \nThe Moonlit Promenade has overlapping signal areas with Nimbus Plaza, Flint Forge Quarter. \nThe Nimbus Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Twilight Harbor, Flint Forge Quarter, Jasper Marina. \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Oakshade Library. \nThe Oakshade Library has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 22 major locations in the city: Flare Alley, Gilded Archway, Shadowbridge Arcade, Velvet Corner, Amber Plaza, Echo Station, Granite Plaza, Evergreen Circle, Zenith Arena, Oakshade Library, Jade Fountain, Duskwood Park, Moonlit Promenade, Skyline Gardens, Horizon Mall, Maplewood Conservatory, Rosewood Hall, Silvercrest Observatory, Quartz District, Temple Square, Westgate Station and Brass Lantern Tavern. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway, Amber Plaza, Evergreen Circle, Zenith Arena, Oakshade Library, Duskwood Park, Skyline Gardens, Silvercrest Observatory, Temple Square. \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Amber Plaza, Echo Station, Granite Plaza, Evergreen Circle, Oakshade Library, Jade Fountain, Horizon Mall, Rosewood Hall, Silvercrest Observatory, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Shadowbridge Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Amber Plaza, Granite Plaza, Evergreen Circle, Zenith Arena, Duskwood Park, Moonlit Promenade, Skyline Gardens, Maplewood Conservatory, Silvercrest Observatory, Quartz District, Westgate Station, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Velvet Corner has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza, Jade Fountain, Duskwood Park, Rosewood Hall, Temple Square. \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Evergreen Circle, Zenith Arena, Moonlit Promenade, Skyline Gardens, Maplewood Conservatory, Rosewood Hall, Silvercrest Observatory, Quartz District, Temple Square. \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza, Evergreen Circle, Zenith Arena, Rosewood Hall, Quartz District, Temple Square. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Zenith Arena, Oakshade Library, Horizon Mall, Maplewood Conservatory, Temple Square, Westgate Station. \nThe Evergreen Circle has overlapping signal areas with Zenith Arena, Oakshade Library, Jade Fountain, Moonlit Promenade, Skyline Gardens, Temple Square, Westgate Station. \nThe Zenith Arena has overlapping signal areas with Oakshade Library, Duskwood Park, Maplewood Conservatory, Rosewood Hall, Silvercrest Observatory, Quartz District, Temple Square, Westgate Station, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Oakshade Library has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens, Silvercrest Observatory, Temple Square. \nThe Jade Fountain has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park, Horizon Mall, Rosewood Hall, Silvercrest Observatory, Temple Square. \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Rosewood Hall, Westgate Station. \nThe Moonlit Promenade has overlapping signal areas with Quartz District, Westgate Station, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Rosewood Hall, Temple Square, Westgate Station. \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Rosewood Hall, Quartz District, Westgate Station. \nThe Rosewood Hall has overlapping signal areas with Quartz District, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Westgate Station, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 22 major locations in the city: Northwind Tower, King’s Row, Copper Clock Square, Zenith Arena, Jade Fountain, Horizon Mall, Temple Square, Silvercrest Observatory, Brass Lantern Tavern, Lunar Pier, Westgate Station, Mosaic Plaza, Shadowbridge Arcade, Velvet Corner, Opal Theater, Sapphire Arena, Cobalt Market, Umbra Theater, Flint Forge Quarter, Amber Plaza, Jasper Marina and Lighthouse Point. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Horizon Mall, Silvercrest Observatory, Brass Lantern Tavern, Mosaic Plaza, Opal Theater, Sapphire Arena, Cobalt Market, Lighthouse Point. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Westgate Station, Amber Plaza. \nThe Copper Clock Square has overlapping signal areas with Jade Fountain, Brass Lantern Tavern, Westgate Station, Mosaic Plaza, Sapphire Arena, Flint Forge Quarter, Amber Plaza, Lighthouse Point. \nThe Zenith Arena has overlapping signal areas with Horizon Mall, Silvercrest Observatory, Brass Lantern Tavern, Velvet Corner, Umbra Theater, Flint Forge Quarter, Amber Plaza, Lighthouse Point. \nThe Jade Fountain has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza, Jasper Marina. \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Westgate Station, Velvet Corner, Opal Theater, Sapphire Arena, Amber Plaza, Jasper Marina, Lighthouse Point. \nThe Temple Square has overlapping signal areas with Westgate Station, Mosaic Plaza, Shadowbridge Arcade, Velvet Corner, Opal Theater, Sapphire Arena, Umbra Theater, Lighthouse Point. \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Lunar Pier, Westgate Station, Opal Theater, Cobalt Market, Amber Plaza, Jasper Marina. \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with Westgate Station, Shadowbridge Arcade, Velvet Corner, Umbra Theater. \nThe Lunar Pier has overlapping signal areas with Westgate Station, Mosaic Plaza, Velvet Corner, Sapphire Arena, Cobalt Market, Flint Forge Quarter, Amber Plaza, Jasper Marina. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza, Shadowbridge Arcade, Velvet Corner, Cobalt Market, Umbra Theater, Flint Forge Quarter, Amber Plaza. \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade, Sapphire Arena, Cobalt Market, Amber Plaza, Jasper Marina, Lighthouse Point. \nThe Shadowbridge Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Velvet Corner, Umbra Theater, Amber Plaza, Lighthouse Point. \nThe Velvet Corner has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater, Cobalt Market, Umbra Theater, Flint Forge Quarter. \nThe Opal Theater has overlapping signal areas with Amber Plaza, Jasper Marina, Lighthouse Point. \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater, Amber Plaza. \nThe Cobalt Market has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater, Amber Plaza, Jasper Marina. \nThe Umbra Theater has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina, Lighthouse Point. \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 22 major locations in the city: Amber Plaza, Primrose Boulevard, Westgate Station, Horizon Mall, Umbra Theater, Sapphire Arena, Yarrow Plaza, Twilight Harbor, Temple Square, Azure Gardens, Moonlit Promenade, Echo Station, Dragon’s Gate, Quarry Point, Oakshade Library, King’s Row, Northwind Tower, Gilded Archway, Velvet Corner, Opal Theater, Ivory Spire Cathedral and Haven Docks. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena, Yarrow Plaza, Azure Gardens, Moonlit Promenade, Echo Station, Quarry Point, Northwind Tower, Haven Docks. \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with Horizon Mall, Umbra Theater, Yarrow Plaza, Azure Gardens, Moonlit Promenade, Northwind Tower, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater, Yarrow Plaza, Temple Square, Echo Station, Dragon’s Gate, King’s Row, Gilded Archway, Velvet Corner, Haven Docks. \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, Twilight Harbor, Oakshade Library, King’s Row, Opal Theater. \nThe Umbra Theater has overlapping signal areas with Twilight Harbor, Moonlit Promenade, Echo Station, Oakshade Library, King’s Row, Northwind Tower, Velvet Corner, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, Azure Gardens, Echo Station, Dragon’s Gate, Oakshade Library, Northwind Tower, Gilded Archway, Velvet Corner, Opal Theater. \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Twilight Harbor, Azure Gardens, Dragon’s Gate, Oakshade Library, King’s Row, Velvet Corner, Opal Theater, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Twilight Harbor has overlapping signal areas with Moonlit Promenade, Echo Station, King’s Row, Northwind Tower, Velvet Corner. \nThe Temple Square has overlapping signal areas with Quarry Point, Oakshade Library, King’s Row, Opal Theater, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Haven Docks. \nThe Azure Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station, Velvet Corner, Opal Theater, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Moonlit Promenade has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station, Dragon’s Gate, Oakshade Library, Opal Theater, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Haven Docks. \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with Dragon’s Gate, Quarry Point, Opal Theater, Haven Docks. \nThe Dragon’s Gate has overlapping signal areas with Oakshade Library, Northwind Tower. \nThe Quarry Point has overlapping signal areas with Oakshade Library, King’s Row, Opal Theater, Haven Docks. \nThe Oakshade Library has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Gilded Archway, Velvet Corner. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Velvet Corner, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway, Opal Theater, Haven Docks. \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Opal Theater has overlapping signal areas with Haven Docks. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 22 major locations in the city: Ironbridge Crossing, Evergreen Circle, Quartz District, Pennywhistle Arcade, Skyline Gardens, Duskwood Park, Jasper Marina, Cobalt Market, Twilight Harbor, Primrose Boulevard, Moonlit Promenade, Shadowbridge Arcade, Azure Gardens, Dragon’s Gate, Gilded Archway, Temple Square, Horizon Mall, Haven Docks, Silvercrest Observatory, Willowshade Pavilion, Maplewood Conservatory and Northwind Tower. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Ironbridge Crossing has overlapping signal areas with Quartz District, Twilight Harbor, Primrose Boulevard, Moonlit Promenade, Azure Gardens, Gilded Archway, Temple Square. \nThe Evergreen Circle has overlapping signal areas with Quartz District, Pennywhistle Arcade, Duskwood Park, Jasper Marina, Primrose Boulevard, Dragon’s Gate, Temple Square, Horizon Mall. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade, Jasper Marina, Cobalt Market, Primrose Boulevard, Moonlit Promenade, Shadowbridge Arcade, Haven Docks, Silvercrest Observatory, Willowshade Pavilion, Northwind Tower. \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Cobalt Market, Azure Gardens, Dragon’s Gate, Gilded Archway, Willowshade Pavilion, Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Cobalt Market, Twilight Harbor, Silvercrest Observatory, Northwind Tower. \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade, Azure Gardens, Gilded Archway, Northwind Tower. \nThe Jasper Marina has overlapping signal areas with Cobalt Market, Twilight Harbor, Primrose Boulevard, Moonlit Promenade, Dragon’s Gate, Gilded Archway. \nThe Cobalt Market has overlapping signal areas with Twilight Harbor, Moonlit Promenade, Azure Gardens, Gilded Archway, Horizon Mall. \nThe Twilight Harbor has overlapping signal areas with Primrose Boulevard, Moonlit Promenade, Azure Gardens, Gilded Archway, Horizon Mall, Haven Docks, Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with Azure Gardens, Dragon’s Gate, Temple Square, Willowshade Pavilion, Maplewood Conservatory, Northwind Tower. \nThe Moonlit Promenade has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade, Dragon’s Gate, Temple Square, Horizon Mall, Haven Docks, Willowshade Pavilion. \nThe Shadowbridge Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Temple Square, Horizon Mall, Silvercrest Observatory, Maplewood Conservatory, Northwind Tower. \nThe Azure Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway, Temple Square. \nThe Dragon’s Gate has overlapping signal areas with Temple Square, Horizon Mall, Haven Docks, Willowshade Pavilion. \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Temple Square, Horizon Mall, Haven Docks, Silvercrest Observatory, Willowshade Pavilion, Northwind Tower. \nThe Temple Square has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Northwind Tower. \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Haven Docks, Willowshade Pavilion, Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Haven Docks has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory, Willowshade Pavilion. \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion. \nThe Willowshade Pavilion has overlapping signal areas with Maplewood Conservatory, Northwind Tower. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 22 major locations in the city: Temple Square, Umbra Theater, Granite Plaza, Moonlit Promenade, Echo Station, Quartz District, Velvet Corner, Ironbridge Crossing, Willowshade Pavilion, Azure Gardens, Twilight Harbor, Primrose Boulevard, Rosewood Hall, Mosaic Plaza, Flint Forge Quarter, Beacon Tower, Horizon Mall, Evergreen Circle, Opal Theater, Yarrow Plaza, King’s Row and Jasper Marina. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Temple Square has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza, Moonlit Promenade, Echo Station, Quartz District, Ironbridge Crossing, Willowshade Pavilion, Primrose Boulevard, Mosaic Plaza, Flint Forge Quarter, Beacon Tower, Horizon Mall, Opal Theater, Yarrow Plaza, Jasper Marina. \nThe Umbra Theater has overlapping signal areas with Moonlit Promenade, Echo Station, Quartz District, Velvet Corner, Ironbridge Crossing, Azure Gardens, Twilight Harbor, Primrose Boulevard, Mosaic Plaza, Flint Forge Quarter, Horizon Mall, Yarrow Plaza, King’s Row. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station, Quartz District, Velvet Corner, Ironbridge Crossing, Willowshade Pavilion, Azure Gardens, Twilight Harbor, Mosaic Plaza, Beacon Tower, Opal Theater, Yarrow Plaza, Jasper Marina. \nThe Moonlit Promenade has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station, Ironbridge Crossing, Azure Gardens, Rosewood Hall, Mosaic Plaza, Flint Forge Quarter. \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with Ironbridge Crossing, Flint Forge Quarter, Opal Theater. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Twilight Harbor, Yarrow Plaza, King’s Row, Jasper Marina. \nThe Velvet Corner has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Primrose Boulevard, Rosewood Hall, Mosaic Plaza, Evergreen Circle, Jasper Marina. \nThe Ironbridge Crossing has overlapping signal areas with Azure Gardens, Primrose Boulevard, Beacon Tower, Opal Theater, Yarrow Plaza, King’s Row. \nThe Willowshade Pavilion has overlapping signal areas with Twilight Harbor, Rosewood Hall, Mosaic Plaza, Flint Forge Quarter, Yarrow Plaza, Jasper Marina. \nThe Azure Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Flint Forge Quarter, Opal Theater, King’s Row, Jasper Marina. \nThe Twilight Harbor has overlapping signal areas with Primrose Boulevard, Rosewood Hall, Horizon Mall. \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with Flint Forge Quarter, Opal Theater. \nThe Rosewood Hall has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza, Opal Theater, King’s Row. \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Horizon Mall, Yarrow Plaza, King’s Row, Jasper Marina. \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Horizon Mall, Yarrow Plaza. \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater. \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, King’s Row, Jasper Marina. \nThe Evergreen Circle has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza. \nThe Opal Theater has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, King’s Row. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 22 major locations in the city: Beacon Tower, Flare Alley, King’s Row, Lunar Pier, Jade Fountain, Haven Docks, Sapphire Arena, Oakshade Library, Northwind Tower, Nimbus Plaza, Quarry Point, Echo Station, Brass Lantern Tavern, Yarrow Plaza, Skyline Gardens, Cobalt Market, Pennywhistle Arcade, Jasper Marina, Silvercrest Observatory, Velvet Corner, Zenith Arena and Primrose Boulevard. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with Flare Alley, Lunar Pier, Echo Station, Brass Lantern Tavern, Skyline Gardens, Cobalt Market, Silvercrest Observatory. \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Northwind Tower, Nimbus Plaza, Quarry Point, Echo Station, Brass Lantern Tavern, Skyline Gardens, Jasper Marina, Zenith Arena, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier, Jade Fountain, Haven Docks, Oakshade Library, Northwind Tower, Nimbus Plaza, Quarry Point, Yarrow Plaza, Skyline Gardens, Velvet Corner, Zenith Arena. \nThe Lunar Pier has overlapping signal areas with Jade Fountain, Haven Docks, Nimbus Plaza, Quarry Point, Echo Station, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Jade Fountain has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena, Quarry Point, Echo Station, Cobalt Market, Jasper Marina, Velvet Corner, Zenith Arena, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Haven Docks has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena, Nimbus Plaza, Quarry Point, Pennywhistle Arcade, Jasper Marina, Silvercrest Observatory, Velvet Corner. \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with Oakshade Library, Northwind Tower, Nimbus Plaza, Quarry Point, Brass Lantern Tavern, Pennywhistle Arcade, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Oakshade Library has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens, Pennywhistle Arcade, Velvet Corner, Zenith Arena, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Cobalt Market. \nThe Nimbus Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Quarry Point, Echo Station, Yarrow Plaza, Pennywhistle Arcade, Zenith Arena, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Quarry Point has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, Jasper Marina, Silvercrest Observatory, Velvet Corner. \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, Cobalt Market, Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens, Silvercrest Observatory, Velvet Corner. \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens, Pennywhistle Arcade, Jasper Marina, Velvet Corner, Zenith Arena. \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina, Silvercrest Observatory, Velvet Corner, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Cobalt Market has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Zenith Arena, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Jasper Marina has overlapping signal areas with Zenith Arena. \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with Zenith Arena. \nThe Velvet Corner has overlapping signal areas with Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Zenith Arena has overlapping signal areas with Primrose Boulevard. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 22 major locations in the city: Temple Square, Sapphire Arena, Amber Plaza, Nimbus Plaza, Northwind Tower, Haven Docks, Union Square Market, Azure Gardens, Willowshade Pavilion, Quartz District, Quarry Point, Mosaic Plaza, Cobalt Market, Primrose Boulevard, Westgate Station, Jasper Marina, Oakshade Library, Beacon Tower, Flare Alley, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Opal Theater and Knight’s Market. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Temple Square has overlapping signal areas with Azure Gardens, Cobalt Market, Jasper Marina, Beacon Tower, Opal Theater, Knight’s Market. \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with Amber Plaza, Nimbus Plaza, Haven Docks, Quartz District, Westgate Station, Oakshade Library, Beacon Tower, Flare Alley. \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, Mosaic Plaza, Jasper Marina, Oakshade Library, Flare Alley, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Opal Theater, Knight’s Market. \nThe Nimbus Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Quarry Point, Mosaic Plaza, Cobalt Market, Primrose Boulevard, Westgate Station, Jasper Marina, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza, Primrose Boulevard, Flare Alley, Opal Theater. \nThe Haven Docks has overlapping signal areas with Union Square Market, Azure Gardens, Willowshade Pavilion, Cobalt Market, Primrose Boulevard, Oakshade Library, Beacon Tower, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Knight’s Market. \nThe Union Square Market has overlapping signal areas with Azure Gardens, Quarry Point, Mosaic Plaza, Jasper Marina, Oakshade Library, Opal Theater. \nThe Azure Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Quarry Point, Westgate Station, Opal Theater, Knight’s Market. \nThe Willowshade Pavilion has overlapping signal areas with Quartz District, Quarry Point, Mosaic Plaza, Primrose Boulevard, Jasper Marina, Oakshade Library, Beacon Tower, Flare Alley. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Quarry Point, Cobalt Market, Westgate Station, Oakshade Library, Beacon Tower, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Opal Theater. \nThe Quarry Point has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza, Westgate Station, Jasper Marina, Oakshade Library, Flare Alley, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Cobalt Market, Primrose Boulevard, Jasper Marina, Flare Alley, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Cobalt Market has overlapping signal areas with Primrose Boulevard, Jasper Marina, Flare Alley, Opal Theater, Knight’s Market. \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with Westgate Station, Beacon Tower. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Oakshade Library, Flare Alley, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Knight’s Market. \nThe Jasper Marina has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower. \nThe Oakshade Library has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater. \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater, Knight’s Market. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Knight’s Market. \nThe Opal Theater has overlapping signal areas with Knight’s Market. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 22 major locations in the city: Velvet Corner, Copper Clock Square, Pennywhistle Arcade, Maplewood Conservatory, Evergreen Circle, Yarrow Plaza, Mosaic Plaza, King’s Row, Azure Gardens, Umbra Theater, Horizon Mall, Twilight Harbor, Quarry Point, Opal Theater, Sapphire Arena, Flint Forge Quarter, Brass Lantern Tavern, Knight’s Market, Silvercrest Observatory, Jasper Marina, Rosewood Hall and Temple Square. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Velvet Corner has overlapping signal areas with Copper Clock Square, Pennywhistle Arcade, Maplewood Conservatory, Evergreen Circle, Azure Gardens, Horizon Mall, Quarry Point, Opal Theater, Sapphire Arena, Silvercrest Observatory, Jasper Marina, Temple Square. \nThe Copper Clock Square has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade, Yarrow Plaza, Quarry Point, Opal Theater. \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, Azure Gardens, Umbra Theater, Quarry Point, Sapphire Arena, Brass Lantern Tavern, Silvercrest Observatory, Rosewood Hall, Temple Square. \nThe Maplewood Conservatory has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza, Azure Gardens, Twilight Harbor, Opal Theater, Sapphire Arena, Flint Forge Quarter, Brass Lantern Tavern, Knight’s Market, Rosewood Hall. \nThe Evergreen Circle has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza, Umbra Theater, Horizon Mall, Sapphire Arena, Flint Forge Quarter, Knight’s Market, Silvercrest Observatory, Jasper Marina, Temple Square. \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Azure Gardens, Horizon Mall, Opal Theater, Silvercrest Observatory, Temple Square. \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Azure Gardens, Quarry Point, Opal Theater, Sapphire Arena, Flint Forge Quarter. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Twilight Harbor, Knight’s Market, Silvercrest Observatory, Rosewood Hall, Temple Square. \nThe Azure Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Twilight Harbor, Quarry Point, Sapphire Arena, Flint Forge Quarter, Knight’s Market, Temple Square. \nThe Umbra Theater has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater, Flint Forge Quarter, Brass Lantern Tavern, Silvercrest Observatory, Jasper Marina, Temple Square. \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater, Knight’s Market, Jasper Marina. \nThe Twilight Harbor has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena, Flint Forge Quarter, Brass Lantern Tavern, Silvercrest Observatory, Jasper Marina, Temple Square. \nThe Quarry Point has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Knight’s Market. \nThe Opal Theater has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena, Brass Lantern Tavern, Silvercrest Observatory, Rosewood Hall. \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Rosewood Hall. \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory, Jasper Marina. \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with Knight’s Market, Silvercrest Observatory, Jasper Marina. \nThe Knight’s Market has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina, Rosewood Hall. \nThe Jasper Marina has overlapping signal areas with Rosewood Hall. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",
