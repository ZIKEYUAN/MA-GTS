  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas.

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas.

I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway, Dragon’s Gate, Horizon Mall, Duskwood Park, Quartz District, Beacon Tower, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park, Skyline Gardens, Azure Gardens, Westgate Station, Maplewood Conservatory, Beacon Tower, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Dragon’s Gate, Duskwood Park, Quartz District, Maplewood Conservatory, Oakshade Library. \nThe Dragon’s Gate has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park, Maplewood Conservatory, Oakshade Library, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park, Azure Gardens, Ironbridge Crossing, Maplewood Conservatory, Oakshade Library. \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Azure Gardens, Ironbridge Crossing, Westgate Station, Oakshade Library, Brass Lantern Tavern, Twilight Harbor. \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Azure Gardens, Beacon Tower, Brass Lantern Tavern, Twilight Harbor. \nThe Azure Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Oakshade Library, Beacon Tower, Twilight Harbor. \nThe Ironbridge Crossing has overlapping signal areas with Westgate Station, Quartz District. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Quartz District, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Twilight Harbor. \nThe Maplewood Conservatory has overlapping signal areas with Oakshade Library, Beacon Tower. \nThe Oakshade Library has overlapping signal areas with Twilight Harbor. \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with Twilight Harbor. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference.

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 16 major locations in the city: Silvercrest Observatory, Primrose Boulevard, Duskwood Park, Gilded Archway, Granite Plaza, Twilight Harbor, Nimbus Plaza, Quarry Point, Haven Docks, Northwind Tower, Flint Forge Quarter, Westgate Station, Horizon Mall, Skyline Gardens, Mosaic Plaza and Moonlit Promenade. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway, Granite Plaza, Twilight Harbor, Nimbus Plaza, Quarry Point, Flint Forge Quarter, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with Quarry Point, Haven Docks, Flint Forge Quarter, Westgate Station, Mosaic Plaza. \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway, Twilight Harbor, Nimbus Plaza, Quarry Point, Skyline Gardens, Mosaic Plaza. \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Twilight Harbor, Quarry Point, Northwind Tower, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Nimbus Plaza, Haven Docks, Horizon Mall, Skyline Gardens, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Twilight Harbor has overlapping signal areas with Nimbus Plaza, Quarry Point, Northwind Tower, Skyline Gardens, Mosaic Plaza. \nThe Nimbus Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Haven Docks, Northwind Tower, Flint Forge Quarter, Mosaic Plaza. \nThe Quarry Point has overlapping signal areas with Haven Docks, Westgate Station, Mosaic Plaza. \nThe Haven Docks has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, Skyline Gardens, Mosaic Plaza, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with Westgate Station, Mosaic Plaza, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Horizon Mall, Skyline Gardens. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens, Mosaic Plaza. \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference.

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas.

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas.

The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Willowshade Pavilion has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena, Flare Alley, Skyline Gardens, Pennywhistle Arcade, Horizon Mall. \nThe Haven Docks has overlapping signal areas with Cobalt Market, Flare Alley, Maplewood Conservatory, Pennywhistle Arcade, Amber Plaza, Knight’s Market, Temple Square. \nThe Nimbus Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater, Flare Alley, Skyline Gardens, Maplewood Conservatory, Pennywhistle Arcade, Knight’s Market. \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway, Flare Alley, Skyline Gardens, Maplewood Conservatory, Pennywhistle Arcade, Knight’s Market, Temple Square. \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Cobalt Market, Opal Theater, Pennywhistle Arcade, Knight’s Market. \nThe Twilight Harbor has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater, Pennywhistle Arcade, Horizon Mall, Knight’s Market, Temple Square. \nThe Cobalt Market has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater, Flare Alley, Skyline Gardens, Maplewood Conservatory, Amber Plaza. \nThe Opal Theater has overlapping signal areas with Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade, Amber Plaza, Knight’s Market, Temple Square. \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Horizon Mall, Temple Square. \nThe Maplewood Conservatory has overlapping signal areas with Horizon Mall, Knight’s Market. \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Temple Square. \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Knight’s Market, Temple Square. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference.

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas.

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas.

The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with Oakshade Library, Shadowbridge Arcade, Union Square Market, Azure Gardens, Granite Plaza, Flare Alley, Beacon Tower. \nThe Quarry Point has overlapping signal areas with Twilight Harbor, Shadowbridge Arcade, Union Square Market, Azure Gardens, Granite Plaza, Opal Theater, Beacon Tower. \nThe Oakshade Library has overlapping signal areas with Cobalt Market, Zenith Arena, Flare Alley. \nThe Twilight Harbor has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, Shadowbridge Arcade, Cobalt Market, Zenith Arena, Granite Plaza, Flare Alley. \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with Zenith Arena, Flare Alley, Opal Theater. \nThe Shadowbridge Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Horizon Mall, Cobalt Market. \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Cobalt Market, Skyline Gardens, Zenith Arena, Granite Plaza, Flare Alley, Beacon Tower. \nThe Cobalt Market has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza, Flare Alley, Opal Theater. \nThe Union Square Market has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens, Granite Plaza, Flare Alley. \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Zenith Arena, Granite Plaza, Flare Alley. \nThe Azure Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Zenith Arena, Flare Alley. \nThe Zenith Arena has overlapping signal areas with Flare Alley, Opal Theater. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater, Beacon Tower. \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater. \nThe Opal Theater has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference.

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas.
