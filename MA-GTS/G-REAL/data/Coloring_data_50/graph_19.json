  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 19 major locations in the city: Copper Clock Square, Primrose Boulevard, Duskwood Park, Cobalt Market, Westgate Station, Lighthouse Point, Dragon’s Gate, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Twilight Harbor, Flare Alley, Silvercrest Observatory, King’s Row, Echo Station, Maplewood Conservatory, Rosewood Hall, Temple Square, Jasper Marina, Azure Gardens and Velvet Corner. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Copper Clock Square has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park, Cobalt Market, Lighthouse Point, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Silvercrest Observatory, Maplewood Conservatory, Rosewood Hall, Temple Square. \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park, Cobalt Market, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Flare Alley, Maplewood Conservatory, Rosewood Hall, Temple Square. \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Cobalt Market, Westgate Station, Dragon’s Gate, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Silvercrest Observatory, King’s Row. \nThe Cobalt Market has overlapping signal areas with Flare Alley, Silvercrest Observatory, Echo Station, Maplewood Conservatory, Rosewood Hall, Temple Square. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Lighthouse Point, Silvercrest Observatory, King’s Row, Echo Station, Jasper Marina, Azure Gardens, Velvet Corner. \nThe Lighthouse Point has overlapping signal areas with Dragon’s Gate, King’s Row, Temple Square, Velvet Corner. \nThe Dragon’s Gate has overlapping signal areas with Flare Alley, King’s Row, Temple Square. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Twilight Harbor, Flare Alley, Silvercrest Observatory, Maplewood Conservatory, Rosewood Hall. \nThe Twilight Harbor has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Rosewood Hall, Jasper Marina. \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory, King’s Row, Echo Station, Rosewood Hall, Jasper Marina, Velvet Corner. \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Echo Station, Maplewood Conservatory, Temple Square, Jasper Marina, Azure Gardens. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Rosewood Hall. \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with Rosewood Hall, Velvet Corner. \nThe Maplewood Conservatory has overlapping signal areas with Temple Square, Jasper Marina, Velvet Corner. \nThe Rosewood Hall has overlapping signal areas with Temple Square, Azure Gardens, Velvet Corner. \nThe Temple Square has overlapping signal areas with Azure Gardens. \nThe Azure Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Velvet Corner. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 19 major locations in the city: Quartz District, Gilded Archway, Flare Alley, Azure Gardens, Sapphire Arena, Jasper Marina, Rosewood Hall, Willowshade Pavilion, Flint Forge Quarter, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Copper Clock Square, Beacon Tower, King’s Row, Haven Docks, Primrose Boulevard, Temple Square, Zenith Arena, Lighthouse Point and Moonlit Promenade. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway, Sapphire Arena, Jasper Marina, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Copper Clock Square, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena, Willowshade Pavilion, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Azure Gardens, Jasper Marina, Haven Docks, Primrose Boulevard, Temple Square, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Azure Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena, Rosewood Hall, Willowshade Pavilion, Flint Forge Quarter, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Copper Clock Square, Primrose Boulevard, Lighthouse Point, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina, Rosewood Hall, Willowshade Pavilion, Copper Clock Square, Haven Docks, Primrose Boulevard, Temple Square. \nThe Jasper Marina has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Beacon Tower, Haven Docks, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Rosewood Hall has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Copper Clock Square, King’s Row, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Willowshade Pavilion has overlapping signal areas with Copper Clock Square, Beacon Tower, Primrose Boulevard, Lighthouse Point, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Copper Clock Square, Beacon Tower, Primrose Boulevard, Zenith Arena. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower, King’s Row, Haven Docks, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Copper Clock Square has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower, Haven Docks. \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Haven Docks, Lighthouse Point, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Temple Square, Lighthouse Point, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Haven Docks has overlapping signal areas with Zenith Arena, Lighthouse Point, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with Temple Square, Zenith Arena, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Temple Square has overlapping signal areas with Lighthouse Point. \nThe Lighthouse Point has overlapping signal areas with Moonlit Promenade. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 19 major locations in the city: Jasper Marina, Mosaic Plaza, Brass Lantern Tavern, Primrose Boulevard, Knight’s Market, Dragon’s Gate, Twilight Harbor, Willowshade Pavilion, Skyline Gardens, King’s Row, Quartz District, Maplewood Conservatory, Temple Square, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Riverstone Wharf, Velvet Corner, Silvercrest Observatory, Zenith Arena and Westgate Station. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Jasper Marina has overlapping signal areas with Dragon’s Gate, Twilight Harbor, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Riverstone Wharf, Velvet Corner, Zenith Arena, Westgate Station. \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Knight’s Market, Twilight Harbor, King’s Row, Quartz District, Maplewood Conservatory, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Riverstone Wharf, Silvercrest Observatory, Westgate Station. \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with Knight’s Market, Dragon’s Gate, Twilight Harbor, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Riverstone Wharf, Westgate Station. \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with Dragon’s Gate, Twilight Harbor, Skyline Gardens, Maplewood Conservatory, Temple Square, Velvet Corner, Silvercrest Observatory, Zenith Arena, Westgate Station. \nThe Knight’s Market has overlapping signal areas with Twilight Harbor, Quartz District, Riverstone Wharf, Westgate Station. \nThe Dragon’s Gate has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens, Quartz District, Silvercrest Observatory, Westgate Station. \nThe Twilight Harbor has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Riverstone Wharf, Velvet Corner, Silvercrest Observatory, Westgate Station. \nThe Willowshade Pavilion has overlapping signal areas with Maplewood Conservatory, Temple Square, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Silvercrest Observatory, Zenith Arena, Westgate Station. \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Quartz District, Maplewood Conservatory, Temple Square, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Riverstone Wharf, Velvet Corner, Silvercrest Observatory, Zenith Arena. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Quartz District, Maplewood Conservatory, Westgate Station. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory, Zenith Arena. \nThe Maplewood Conservatory has overlapping signal areas with Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Temple Square has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral, Riverstone Wharf, Westgate Station. \nThe Riverstone Wharf has overlapping signal areas with Velvet Corner. \nThe Velvet Corner has overlapping signal areas with Westgate Station. \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with Zenith Arena. \nThe Zenith Arena has overlapping signal areas with Westgate Station. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 19 major locations in the city: Oakshade Library, Azure Gardens, Cobalt Market, Flint Forge Quarter, Rosewood Hall, Umbra Theater, Duskwood Park, Lighthouse Point, Copper Clock Square, Knight’s Market, Gilded Archway, Amber Plaza, Zenith Arena, Skyline Gardens, Flare Alley, Echo Station, Ivory Spire Cathedral, King’s Row and Opal Theater. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Oakshade Library has overlapping signal areas with Azure Gardens, Cobalt Market, Rosewood Hall, Duskwood Park, Amber Plaza, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Opal Theater. \nThe Azure Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Cobalt Market, Duskwood Park, Knight’s Market, Amber Plaza, Zenith Arena, Flare Alley, Ivory Spire Cathedral, King’s Row, Opal Theater. \nThe Cobalt Market has overlapping signal areas with Flint Forge Quarter, Duskwood Park, Lighthouse Point, Gilded Archway, Amber Plaza, Zenith Arena, Echo Station, Opal Theater. \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater, Copper Clock Square, Flare Alley, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Opal Theater. \nThe Rosewood Hall has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway, Zenith Arena, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Opal Theater. \nThe Umbra Theater has overlapping signal areas with Copper Clock Square, Gilded Archway, Zenith Arena, Echo Station, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Opal Theater. \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Copper Clock Square, Gilded Archway, Zenith Arena, Skyline Gardens, Opal Theater. \nThe Lighthouse Point has overlapping signal areas with Copper Clock Square, Knight’s Market, Amber Plaza, Skyline Gardens, Echo Station, King’s Row, Opal Theater. \nThe Copper Clock Square has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway, Zenith Arena, Skyline Gardens, Flare Alley, Echo Station. \nThe Knight’s Market has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station, Opal Theater. \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens, Flare Alley, Opal Theater. \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Zenith Arena, Flare Alley, Echo Station. \nThe Zenith Arena has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens. \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station, Opal Theater. \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station, King’s Row. \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral, King’s Row. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 19 major locations in the city: Union Square Market, Twilight Harbor, Cobalt Market, Brass Lantern Tavern, Duskwood Park, Willowshade Pavilion, Sapphire Arena, Lighthouse Point, Westgate Station, Horizon Mall, Amber Plaza, Flint Forge Quarter, Skyline Gardens, Dragon’s Gate, Jasper Marina, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Haven Docks, Yarrow Plaza and Silvercrest Observatory. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Union Square Market has overlapping signal areas with Twilight Harbor, Cobalt Market, Brass Lantern Tavern, Willowshade Pavilion, Sapphire Arena, Lighthouse Point, Skyline Gardens, Jasper Marina, Yarrow Plaza. \nThe Twilight Harbor has overlapping signal areas with Cobalt Market, Westgate Station, Amber Plaza, Skyline Gardens, Dragon’s Gate, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Haven Docks, Silvercrest Observatory. \nThe Cobalt Market has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Duskwood Park, Sapphire Arena, Lighthouse Point, Westgate Station, Horizon Mall, Jasper Marina, Haven Docks, Yarrow Plaza. \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Sapphire Arena, Horizon Mall, Flint Forge Quarter, Jasper Marina, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Haven Docks. \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Lighthouse Point, Horizon Mall, Amber Plaza, Flint Forge Quarter, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Yarrow Plaza, Silvercrest Observatory. \nThe Willowshade Pavilion has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena, Skyline Gardens, Yarrow Plaza. \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with Lighthouse Point, Flint Forge Quarter, Dragon’s Gate, Jasper Marina, Yarrow Plaza. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Horizon Mall, Amber Plaza, Flint Forge Quarter, Dragon’s Gate, Haven Docks, Silvercrest Observatory. \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Amber Plaza, Dragon’s Gate, Haven Docks, Yarrow Plaza. \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Flint Forge Quarter, Skyline Gardens, Dragon’s Gate, Jasper Marina, Yarrow Plaza. \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Dragon’s Gate, Haven Docks, Silvercrest Observatory. \nThe Dragon’s Gate has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Jasper Marina has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Haven Docks, Yarrow Plaza. \nThe Haven Docks has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 19 major locations in the city: Temple Square, Northwind Tower, Quartz District, Beacon Tower, Primrose Boulevard, Cobalt Market, Flare Alley, Maplewood Conservatory, Echo Station, Flint Forge Quarter, Amber Plaza, Westgate Station, Brass Lantern Tavern, Azure Gardens, Granite Plaza, Evergreen Circle, Velvet Corner, Sapphire Arena and Willowshade Pavilion. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Temple Square has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower, Primrose Boulevard, Cobalt Market, Flare Alley, Maplewood Conservatory, Flint Forge Quarter, Westgate Station, Granite Plaza, Evergreen Circle, Sapphire Arena. \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with Quartz District, Cobalt Market, Flint Forge Quarter, Amber Plaza, Azure Gardens, Granite Plaza, Sapphire Arena. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Flare Alley, Maplewood Conservatory, Amber Plaza, Westgate Station, Evergreen Circle. \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with Maplewood Conservatory, Echo Station, Flint Forge Quarter, Amber Plaza, Granite Plaza, Evergreen Circle, Sapphire Arena. \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with Cobalt Market, Maplewood Conservatory, Amber Plaza, Westgate Station. \nThe Cobalt Market has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station, Flint Forge Quarter, Granite Plaza. \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station, Brass Lantern Tavern, Azure Gardens, Evergreen Circle, Velvet Corner, Willowshade Pavilion. \nThe Maplewood Conservatory has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station, Flint Forge Quarter, Amber Plaza, Azure Gardens, Sapphire Arena, Willowshade Pavilion. \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with Flint Forge Quarter, Azure Gardens, Evergreen Circle, Sapphire Arena, Willowshade Pavilion. \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Westgate Station, Azure Gardens, Sapphire Arena. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Azure Gardens, Granite Plaza, Evergreen Circle, Sapphire Arena, Willowshade Pavilion. \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with Azure Gardens, Evergreen Circle. \nThe Azure Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza, Evergreen Circle, Sapphire Arena, Willowshade Pavilion. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion. \nThe Evergreen Circle has overlapping signal areas with Velvet Corner, Sapphire Arena. \nThe Velvet Corner has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 19 major locations in the city: Northwind Tower, Opal Theater, Granite Plaza, Lighthouse Point, Moonlit Promenade, Amber Plaza, Nimbus Plaza, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Quarry Point, Jasper Marina, Temple Square, Lunar Pier, Umbra Theater, Copper Clock Square, Evergreen Circle, Horizon Mall, Echo Station, Flint Forge Quarter and Dragon’s Gate. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater, Granite Plaza, Moonlit Promenade, Quarry Point, Temple Square, Lunar Pier, Copper Clock Square, Horizon Mall, Echo Station, Flint Forge Quarter. \nThe Opal Theater has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza, Nimbus Plaza, Quarry Point, Lunar Pier, Copper Clock Square, Horizon Mall, Dragon’s Gate. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Lighthouse Point, Nimbus Plaza, Quarry Point, Jasper Marina, Copper Clock Square, Echo Station. \nThe Lighthouse Point has overlapping signal areas with Moonlit Promenade, Amber Plaza, Quarry Point, Lunar Pier, Copper Clock Square, Horizon Mall, Echo Station. \nThe Moonlit Promenade has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral, Temple Square, Umbra Theater, Copper Clock Square, Echo Station, Dragon’s Gate. \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral, Quarry Point, Lunar Pier, Umbra Theater, Echo Station, Dragon’s Gate. \nThe Nimbus Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Temple Square, Evergreen Circle, Flint Forge Quarter. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Temple Square, Lunar Pier, Copper Clock Square, Flint Forge Quarter. \nThe Quarry Point has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina, Evergreen Circle, Horizon Mall. \nThe Jasper Marina has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier, Evergreen Circle, Flint Forge Quarter. \nThe Temple Square has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater, Copper Clock Square, Evergreen Circle, Dragon’s Gate. \nThe Lunar Pier has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater, Horizon Mall, Echo Station, Flint Forge Quarter. \nThe Umbra Theater has overlapping signal areas with Evergreen Circle, Horizon Mall, Echo Station. \nThe Copper Clock Square has overlapping signal areas with Evergreen Circle, Horizon Mall, Echo Station. \nThe Evergreen Circle has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station. \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with Flint Forge Quarter, Dragon’s Gate. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 19 major locations in the city: Dragon’s Gate, Lunar Pier, Riverstone Wharf, Flare Alley, Jasper Marina, Amber Plaza, Cobalt Market, Nimbus Plaza, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Shadowbridge Arcade, Evergreen Circle, Duskwood Park, Northwind Tower, Velvet Corner, Yarrow Plaza, Granite Plaza, Pennywhistle Arcade, Umbra Theater and Maplewood Conservatory. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Dragon’s Gate has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier, Nimbus Plaza, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Shadowbridge Arcade, Duskwood Park, Velvet Corner, Yarrow Plaza, Umbra Theater, Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Lunar Pier has overlapping signal areas with Riverstone Wharf, Flare Alley, Amber Plaza, Cobalt Market, Nimbus Plaza, Northwind Tower, Yarrow Plaza, Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Riverstone Wharf has overlapping signal areas with Flare Alley, Cobalt Market, Shadowbridge Arcade, Duskwood Park, Northwind Tower, Velvet Corner, Yarrow Plaza, Granite Plaza, Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina, Cobalt Market, Nimbus Plaza, Shadowbridge Arcade, Duskwood Park, Northwind Tower, Yarrow Plaza, Umbra Theater. \nThe Jasper Marina has overlapping signal areas with Nimbus Plaza, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Shadowbridge Arcade, Duskwood Park, Yarrow Plaza, Granite Plaza, Pennywhistle Arcade, Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Evergreen Circle, Granite Plaza, Umbra Theater, Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Cobalt Market has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park, Velvet Corner, Yarrow Plaza, Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Nimbus Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral, Duskwood Park, Umbra Theater. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, Granite Plaza, Pennywhistle Arcade, Umbra Theater, Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Shadowbridge Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater, Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Evergreen Circle has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park, Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, Velvet Corner, Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Velvet Corner has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater, Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade, Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater. \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater, Maplewood Conservatory. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 19 major locations in the city: Azure Gardens, Echo Station, Flare Alley, Beacon Tower, Cobalt Market, Opal Theater, Willowshade Pavilion, Jade Fountain, Haven Docks, Moonlit Promenade, Northwind Tower, Silvercrest Observatory, Oakshade Library, Amber Plaza, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Pennywhistle Arcade, Temple Square, Nimbus Plaza and Flint Forge Quarter. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Azure Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Flare Alley, Beacon Tower, Willowshade Pavilion, Jade Fountain, Haven Docks, Oakshade Library, Amber Plaza. \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with Flare Alley, Haven Docks, Moonlit Promenade, Oakshade Library, Flint Forge Quarter. \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Moonlit Promenade, Silvercrest Observatory, Oakshade Library, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Nimbus Plaza, Flint Forge Quarter. \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with Cobalt Market, Moonlit Promenade, Silvercrest Observatory, Amber Plaza, Pennywhistle Arcade, Nimbus Plaza. \nThe Cobalt Market has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater, Willowshade Pavilion, Moonlit Promenade, Oakshade Library, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Opal Theater has overlapping signal areas with Jade Fountain, Haven Docks, Moonlit Promenade, Oakshade Library, Temple Square, Flint Forge Quarter. \nThe Willowshade Pavilion has overlapping signal areas with Moonlit Promenade, Silvercrest Observatory, Temple Square. \nThe Jade Fountain has overlapping signal areas with Haven Docks, Moonlit Promenade, Silvercrest Observatory, Amber Plaza, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Pennywhistle Arcade, Temple Square, Nimbus Plaza, Flint Forge Quarter. \nThe Haven Docks has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory, Oakshade Library, Amber Plaza, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Temple Square. \nThe Moonlit Promenade has overlapping signal areas with Oakshade Library, Amber Plaza, Temple Square, Nimbus Plaza. \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory, Oakshade Library, Pennywhistle Arcade, Temple Square, Flint Forge Quarter. \nThe Oakshade Library has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade, Temple Square, Nimbus Plaza, Flint Forge Quarter. \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Temple Square, Nimbus Plaza. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Temple Square, Nimbus Plaza. \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Nimbus Plaza. \nThe Temple Square has overlapping signal areas with Flint Forge Quarter. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 19 major locations in the city: Jade Fountain, Dragon’s Gate, Twilight Harbor, Cobalt Market, Haven Docks, Amber Plaza, Lunar Pier, Duskwood Park, Azure Gardens, Flint Forge Quarter, Quartz District, Nimbus Plaza, King’s Row, Copper Clock Square, Willowshade Pavilion, Sapphire Arena, Umbra Theater, Moonlit Promenade and Mosaic Plaza. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Jade Fountain has overlapping signal areas with Dragon’s Gate, Twilight Harbor, Cobalt Market, Lunar Pier, Duskwood Park, Quartz District, Nimbus Plaza, King’s Row, Willowshade Pavilion. \nThe Dragon’s Gate has overlapping signal areas with Haven Docks, Lunar Pier, Duskwood Park, Nimbus Plaza, Copper Clock Square, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Twilight Harbor has overlapping signal areas with Cobalt Market, Amber Plaza, Lunar Pier, Flint Forge Quarter, Nimbus Plaza, King’s Row, Copper Clock Square, Willowshade Pavilion, Sapphire Arena. \nThe Cobalt Market has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park, Azure Gardens, Copper Clock Square, Sapphire Arena, Mosaic Plaza. \nThe Haven Docks has overlapping signal areas with Azure Gardens, Flint Forge Quarter, Quartz District, King’s Row, Sapphire Arena, Umbra Theater, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier, Nimbus Plaza, Sapphire Arena, Mosaic Plaza. \nThe Lunar Pier has overlapping signal areas with Azure Gardens, Quartz District, Nimbus Plaza, Willowshade Pavilion, Umbra Theater, Moonlit Promenade, Mosaic Plaza. \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Flint Forge Quarter, Quartz District, Sapphire Arena, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Azure Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Flint Forge Quarter, Quartz District, King’s Row, Sapphire Arena, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater, Mosaic Plaza. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Sapphire Arena, Umbra Theater, Mosaic Plaza. \nThe Nimbus Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Moonlit Promenade, Mosaic Plaza. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Copper Clock Square, Sapphire Arena. \nThe Copper Clock Square has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena. \nThe Willowshade Pavilion has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena, Umbra Theater, Mosaic Plaza. \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater. \nThe Moonlit Promenade has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Twilight Harbor, Oakshade Library, Cobalt Market, Echo Station, Jade Fountain, Quartz District, Brass Lantern Tavern, Gilded Archway. \nThe Twilight Harbor has overlapping signal areas with Nimbus Plaza, Umbra Theater, Echo Station, Quartz District, Brass Lantern Tavern, Gilded Archway, Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Cobalt Market, Jasper Marina, Ironbridge Crossing, Echo Station, Brass Lantern Tavern, Copper Clock Square, Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Oakshade Library has overlapping signal areas with Zenith Arena, Cobalt Market, Jasper Marina, Umbra Theater, Echo Station, Velvet Corner. \nThe Nimbus Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Cobalt Market, Jasper Marina, Ironbridge Crossing, Jade Fountain, Maplewood Conservatory, Gilded Archway, Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Zenith Arena has overlapping signal areas with Cobalt Market, Jasper Marina, Ironbridge Crossing, Umbra Theater, Jade Fountain, Quartz District. \nThe Cobalt Market has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina, Ironbridge Crossing, Umbra Theater, Brass Lantern Tavern, Gilded Archway. \nThe Jasper Marina has overlapping signal areas with Ironbridge Crossing, Umbra Theater, Echo Station, Maplewood Conservatory, Quartz District, Gilded Archway. \nThe Ironbridge Crossing has overlapping signal areas with Jade Fountain, Brass Lantern Tavern, Velvet Corner. \nThe Umbra Theater has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station, Quartz District, Copper Clock Square, Velvet Corner. \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with Jade Fountain, Quartz District, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Jade Fountain has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Maplewood Conservatory has overlapping signal areas with Quartz District, Gilded Archway, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway, Velvet Corner. \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Velvet Corner, Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Copper Clock Square has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 19 major locations in the city: Silvercrest Observatory, Haven Docks, Quarry Point, Nimbus Plaza, Yarrow Plaza, Willowshade Pavilion, Primrose Boulevard, Pennywhistle Arcade, Opal Theater, Mosaic Plaza, King’s Row, Flare Alley, Zenith Arena, Evergreen Circle, Flint Forge Quarter, Moonlit Promenade, Granite Plaza, Union Square Market and Jasper Marina. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with Haven Docks, Nimbus Plaza, Yarrow Plaza, Primrose Boulevard, Pennywhistle Arcade, Opal Theater, King’s Row, Flare Alley, Zenith Arena, Evergreen Circle. \nThe Haven Docks has overlapping signal areas with Nimbus Plaza, Yarrow Plaza, Primrose Boulevard, Flare Alley, Evergreen Circle. \nThe Quarry Point has overlapping signal areas with Nimbus Plaza, Willowshade Pavilion, Pennywhistle Arcade, Mosaic Plaza, King’s Row, Evergreen Circle, Moonlit Promenade, Granite Plaza, Union Square Market, Jasper Marina. \nThe Nimbus Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, Willowshade Pavilion, Primrose Boulevard, Pennywhistle Arcade, Zenith Arena, Evergreen Circle, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Mosaic Plaza, Jasper Marina. \nThe Willowshade Pavilion has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza, King’s Row, Zenith Arena, Jasper Marina. \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater, King’s Row, Flare Alley, Zenith Arena, Flint Forge Quarter, Moonlit Promenade, Union Square Market. \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza, Flare Alley, Moonlit Promenade, Union Square Market, Jasper Marina. \nThe Opal Theater has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Evergreen Circle, Flint Forge Quarter, Moonlit Promenade, Granite Plaza. \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Flint Forge Quarter, Granite Plaza, Jasper Marina. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Zenith Arena, Granite Plaza, Union Square Market, Jasper Marina. \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Flint Forge Quarter. \nThe Zenith Arena has overlapping signal areas with Evergreen Circle. \nThe Evergreen Circle has overlapping signal areas with Moonlit Promenade, Granite Plaza. \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza, Jasper Marina. \nThe Moonlit Promenade has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Union Square Market. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 19 major locations in the city: Echo Station, Nimbus Plaza, Moonlit Promenade, Evergreen Circle, Beacon Tower, Haven Docks, Brass Lantern Tavern, Northwind Tower, Zenith Arena, King’s Row, Quartz District, Knight’s Market, Cobalt Market, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Amber Plaza, Twilight Harbor, Horizon Mall, Dragon’s Gate and Maplewood Conservatory. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with Haven Docks, Zenith Arena, Knight’s Market, Amber Plaza, Twilight Harbor, Horizon Mall, Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Nimbus Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Evergreen Circle, Brass Lantern Tavern, Northwind Tower, Quartz District, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Amber Plaza, Twilight Harbor, Dragon’s Gate. \nThe Moonlit Promenade has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower, Brass Lantern Tavern, Northwind Tower, Zenith Arena, King’s Row, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Twilight Harbor. \nThe Evergreen Circle has overlapping signal areas with Haven Docks, Brass Lantern Tavern, Northwind Tower, Zenith Arena, Quartz District, Knight’s Market, Cobalt Market, Amber Plaza, Twilight Harbor, Horizon Mall. \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, Zenith Arena, King’s Row, Quartz District. \nThe Haven Docks has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, Zenith Arena, King’s Row, Knight’s Market, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Dragon’s Gate. \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with Zenith Arena, Quartz District, Twilight Harbor, Dragon’s Gate. \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with Quartz District, Twilight Harbor, Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Zenith Arena has overlapping signal areas with Quartz District, Knight’s Market, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Twilight Harbor, Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Knight’s Market, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Knight’s Market has overlapping signal areas with Amber Plaza, Horizon Mall, Dragon’s Gate, Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Cobalt Market has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral, Amber Plaza, Twilight Harbor, Dragon’s Gate. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Amber Plaza, Horizon Mall. \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Horizon Mall. \nThe Twilight Harbor has overlapping signal areas with Dragon’s Gate, Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Dragon’s Gate. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 19 major locations in the city: Haven Docks, King’s Row, Pennywhistle Arcade, Horizon Mall, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Beacon Tower, Quartz District, Rosewood Hall, Granite Plaza, Twilight Harbor, Dragon’s Gate, Zenith Arena, Temple Square, Copper Clock Square, Willowshade Pavilion, Quarry Point, Evergreen Circle, Duskwood Park and Echo Station. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Haven Docks has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade, Twilight Harbor, Temple Square, Evergreen Circle, Echo Station. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Twilight Harbor, Duskwood Park. \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral, Rosewood Hall, Twilight Harbor, Dragon’s Gate, Zenith Arena, Copper Clock Square, Willowshade Pavilion. \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral, Beacon Tower, Quartz District, Rosewood Hall, Granite Plaza, Twilight Harbor, Dragon’s Gate, Copper Clock Square, Duskwood Park. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Quartz District, Rosewood Hall, Granite Plaza, Dragon’s Gate, Zenith Arena, Temple Square, Copper Clock Square, Echo Station. \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with Quartz District, Rosewood Hall, Twilight Harbor, Dragon’s Gate, Temple Square, Copper Clock Square, Willowshade Pavilion, Evergreen Circle. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Rosewood Hall, Twilight Harbor, Dragon’s Gate, Willowshade Pavilion, Quarry Point, Echo Station. \nThe Rosewood Hall has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza, Twilight Harbor, Dragon’s Gate, Quarry Point, Evergreen Circle, Duskwood Park, Echo Station. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Twilight Harbor, Evergreen Circle, Duskwood Park, Echo Station. \nThe Twilight Harbor has overlapping signal areas with Temple Square, Willowshade Pavilion. \nThe Dragon’s Gate has overlapping signal areas with Temple Square, Duskwood Park. \nThe Zenith Arena has overlapping signal areas with Temple Square, Copper Clock Square, Willowshade Pavilion, Evergreen Circle. \nThe Temple Square has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Evergreen Circle. \nThe Copper Clock Square has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station. \nThe Willowshade Pavilion has overlapping signal areas with Quarry Point, Duskwood Park. \nThe Evergreen Circle has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park, Echo Station. \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 19 major locations in the city: Cobalt Market, Silvercrest Observatory, Lunar Pier, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Quarry Point, Jasper Marina, Velvet Corner, Copper Clock Square, Pennywhistle Arcade, Oakshade Library, Haven Docks, Amber Plaza, Sapphire Arena, Maplewood Conservatory, Lighthouse Point, Azure Gardens, Flare Alley, Opal Theater and Echo Station. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Cobalt Market has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory, Quarry Point, Velvet Corner, Pennywhistle Arcade, Oakshade Library, Haven Docks, Amber Plaza, Azure Gardens, Flare Alley, Opal Theater. \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier, Quarry Point, Oakshade Library, Maplewood Conservatory, Flare Alley, Echo Station. \nThe Lunar Pier has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral, Jasper Marina, Copper Clock Square, Pennywhistle Arcade, Oakshade Library, Haven Docks, Sapphire Arena, Maplewood Conservatory, Lighthouse Point, Azure Gardens, Opal Theater, Echo Station. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Oakshade Library, Sapphire Arena, Lighthouse Point. \nThe Quarry Point has overlapping signal areas with Oakshade Library, Haven Docks, Lighthouse Point, Flare Alley, Echo Station. \nThe Jasper Marina has overlapping signal areas with Copper Clock Square, Pennywhistle Arcade, Lighthouse Point, Azure Gardens, Flare Alley, Opal Theater, Echo Station. \nThe Velvet Corner has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena, Maplewood Conservatory, Opal Theater, Echo Station. \nThe Copper Clock Square has overlapping signal areas with Haven Docks, Amber Plaza, Maplewood Conservatory, Opal Theater. \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena, Azure Gardens, Opal Theater. \nThe Oakshade Library has overlapping signal areas with Haven Docks, Maplewood Conservatory, Lighthouse Point, Azure Gardens, Opal Theater. \nThe Haven Docks has overlapping signal areas with Amber Plaza, Maplewood Conservatory, Lighthouse Point, Azure Gardens, Opal Theater. \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Maplewood Conservatory, Lighthouse Point, Echo Station. \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station. \nThe Azure Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater, Echo Station. \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater, Echo Station. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 19 major locations in the city: Temple Square, Ironbridge Crossing, Lighthouse Point, Cobalt Market, Shadowbridge Arcade, Brass Lantern Tavern, Sapphire Arena, Rosewood Hall, Maplewood Conservatory, Opal Theater, Yarrow Plaza, Northwind Tower, Evergreen Circle, Dragon’s Gate, Westgate Station, Oakshade Library, Mosaic Plaza, Quartz District and Primrose Boulevard. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Temple Square has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade, Brass Lantern Tavern, Sapphire Arena, Yarrow Plaza, Northwind Tower, Evergreen Circle, Dragon’s Gate, Westgate Station. \nThe Ironbridge Crossing has overlapping signal areas with Lighthouse Point, Shadowbridge Arcade, Brass Lantern Tavern, Rosewood Hall, Yarrow Plaza, Northwind Tower, Dragon’s Gate, Westgate Station, Quartz District, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Lighthouse Point has overlapping signal areas with Cobalt Market, Shadowbridge Arcade, Sapphire Arena, Maplewood Conservatory, Yarrow Plaza, Northwind Tower, Evergreen Circle, Mosaic Plaza, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Cobalt Market has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade, Sapphire Arena, Rosewood Hall, Opal Theater, Dragon’s Gate, Westgate Station, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Shadowbridge Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Sapphire Arena, Rosewood Hall, Maplewood Conservatory, Quartz District. \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with Rosewood Hall, Maplewood Conservatory, Northwind Tower, Mosaic Plaza, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with Rosewood Hall, Maplewood Conservatory, Opal Theater, Evergreen Circle, Mosaic Plaza. \nThe Rosewood Hall has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater, Oakshade Library, Quartz District. \nThe Maplewood Conservatory has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, Evergreen Circle, Oakshade Library. \nThe Opal Theater has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, Westgate Station, Oakshade Library, Quartz District, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, Evergreen Circle, Westgate Station. \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with Quartz District, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Evergreen Circle has overlapping signal areas with Dragon’s Gate, Westgate Station, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Dragon’s Gate has overlapping signal areas with Oakshade Library, Quartz District, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 19 major locations in the city: Primrose Boulevard, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Riverstone Wharf, Umbra Theater, Echo Station, Willowshade Pavilion, Cobalt Market, Twilight Harbor, Azure Gardens, Granite Plaza, Yarrow Plaza, Lunar Pier, Opal Theater, Flint Forge Quarter, Duskwood Park, Beacon Tower, Nimbus Plaza, Jade Fountain and Silvercrest Observatory. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral, Riverstone Wharf, Azure Gardens, Lunar Pier, Flint Forge Quarter, Nimbus Plaza, Jade Fountain. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station, Willowshade Pavilion, Cobalt Market, Yarrow Plaza, Silvercrest Observatory. \nThe Riverstone Wharf has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater, Echo Station, Willowshade Pavilion, Azure Gardens, Granite Plaza, Opal Theater, Beacon Tower, Silvercrest Observatory. \nThe Umbra Theater has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Cobalt Market, Twilight Harbor, Yarrow Plaza, Lunar Pier, Duskwood Park, Beacon Tower. \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza, Yarrow Plaza, Opal Theater, Flint Forge Quarter, Nimbus Plaza, Silvercrest Observatory. \nThe Willowshade Pavilion has overlapping signal areas with Cobalt Market, Twilight Harbor, Opal Theater, Flint Forge Quarter, Duskwood Park, Nimbus Plaza, Silvercrest Observatory. \nThe Cobalt Market has overlapping signal areas with Twilight Harbor, Flint Forge Quarter, Beacon Tower, Silvercrest Observatory. \nThe Twilight Harbor has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater, Nimbus Plaza, Jade Fountain, Silvercrest Observatory. \nThe Azure Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, Duskwood Park, Nimbus Plaza, Jade Fountain. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Flint Forge Quarter, Beacon Tower, Nimbus Plaza, Jade Fountain, Silvercrest Observatory. \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater, Duskwood Park, Nimbus Plaza. \nThe Lunar Pier has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater, Flint Forge Quarter, Duskwood Park, Nimbus Plaza, Jade Fountain. \nThe Opal Theater has overlapping signal areas with Flint Forge Quarter, Duskwood Park, Nimbus Plaza. \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Nimbus Plaza, Jade Fountain, Silvercrest Observatory. \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 19 major locations in the city: Flint Forge Quarter, Yarrow Plaza, Riverstone Wharf, Northwind Tower, Velvet Corner, Beacon Tower, Jasper Marina, Dragon’s Gate, Evergreen Circle, Mosaic Plaza, Cobalt Market, Nimbus Plaza, Silvercrest Observatory, Horizon Mall, Rosewood Hall, Pennywhistle Arcade, Jade Fountain, Zenith Arena and Azure Gardens. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, Velvet Corner, Jasper Marina, Evergreen Circle, Mosaic Plaza, Nimbus Plaza, Rosewood Hall, Zenith Arena. \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, Velvet Corner, Beacon Tower, Horizon Mall, Azure Gardens. \nThe Riverstone Wharf has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, Beacon Tower, Mosaic Plaza, Nimbus Plaza, Silvercrest Observatory, Rosewood Hall, Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with Velvet Corner, Dragon’s Gate, Nimbus Plaza, Azure Gardens. \nThe Velvet Corner has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower, Jasper Marina, Dragon’s Gate, Evergreen Circle, Mosaic Plaza, Cobalt Market, Pennywhistle Arcade, Jade Fountain, Azure Gardens. \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with Dragon’s Gate, Evergreen Circle, Mosaic Plaza, Silvercrest Observatory, Horizon Mall, Pennywhistle Arcade, Azure Gardens. \nThe Jasper Marina has overlapping signal areas with Evergreen Circle, Mosaic Plaza, Nimbus Plaza, Silvercrest Observatory, Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Dragon’s Gate has overlapping signal areas with Cobalt Market, Nimbus Plaza, Jade Fountain, Azure Gardens. \nThe Evergreen Circle has overlapping signal areas with Cobalt Market, Silvercrest Observatory, Horizon Mall, Rosewood Hall, Jade Fountain. \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade, Jade Fountain. \nThe Cobalt Market has overlapping signal areas with Nimbus Plaza, Silvercrest Observatory, Rosewood Hall, Azure Gardens. \nThe Nimbus Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Jade Fountain, Zenith Arena, Azure Gardens. \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade, Azure Gardens. \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade, Zenith Arena. \nThe Rosewood Hall has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Jade Fountain, Zenith Arena, Azure Gardens. \nThe Jade Fountain has overlapping signal areas with Zenith Arena. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 19 major locations in the city: Mosaic Plaza, Duskwood Park, Brass Lantern Tavern, Umbra Theater, Quartz District, Cobalt Market, Riverstone Wharf, Velvet Corner, Sapphire Arena, Knight’s Market, Jasper Marina, Lighthouse Point, Skyline Gardens, Northwind Tower, Amber Plaza, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Granite Plaza, Ironbridge Crossing and Moonlit Promenade. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park, Quartz District, Riverstone Wharf, Knight’s Market, Lighthouse Point, Skyline Gardens, Amber Plaza, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Ironbridge Crossing, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Cobalt Market, Velvet Corner, Sapphire Arena, Knight’s Market, Amber Plaza, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena, Amber Plaza, Ironbridge Crossing. \nThe Umbra Theater has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena, Knight’s Market, Skyline Gardens, Amber Plaza, Granite Plaza, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Velvet Corner, Sapphire Arena, Lighthouse Point, Skyline Gardens, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Granite Plaza, Ironbridge Crossing, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Cobalt Market has overlapping signal areas with Riverstone Wharf, Velvet Corner, Knight’s Market, Amber Plaza, Ironbridge Crossing, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Riverstone Wharf has overlapping signal areas with Velvet Corner, Knight’s Market, Jasper Marina, Lighthouse Point, Skyline Gardens, Amber Plaza, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Velvet Corner has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena, Knight’s Market, Lighthouse Point, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Granite Plaza. \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens. \nThe Knight’s Market has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Granite Plaza, Ironbridge Crossing. \nThe Jasper Marina has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Granite Plaza, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Lighthouse Point has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza. \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, Granite Plaza, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with Ironbridge Crossing, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral, Granite Plaza, Ironbridge Crossing. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 19 major locations in the city: Primrose Boulevard, Pennywhistle Arcade, Azure Gardens, Lunar Pier, King’s Row, Flare Alley, Rosewood Hall, Horizon Mall, Amber Plaza, Dragon’s Gate, Westgate Station, Umbra Theater, Velvet Corner, Duskwood Park, Ironbridge Crossing, Yarrow Plaza, Jasper Marina, Temple Square and Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade, Horizon Mall, Dragon’s Gate, Duskwood Park, Ironbridge Crossing, Jasper Marina, Temple Square, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Azure Gardens, Flare Alley, Duskwood Park, Yarrow Plaza. \nThe Azure Gardens has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Rosewood Hall, Horizon Mall, Westgate Station, Duskwood Park, Yarrow Plaza, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Lunar Pier has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Flare Alley, Horizon Mall, Amber Plaza, Dragon’s Gate, Westgate Station, Duskwood Park, Ironbridge Crossing, Temple Square. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Flare Alley, Amber Plaza, Umbra Theater, Velvet Corner. \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Horizon Mall, Duskwood Park, Yarrow Plaza, Temple Square. \nThe Rosewood Hall has overlapping signal areas with Ironbridge Crossing, Yarrow Plaza, Temple Square. \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Westgate Station, Velvet Corner, Ironbridge Crossing, Yarrow Plaza, Temple Square. \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Westgate Station, Umbra Theater, Velvet Corner, Duskwood Park, Yarrow Plaza. \nThe Dragon’s Gate has overlapping signal areas with Ironbridge Crossing, Jasper Marina, Temple Square. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater, Velvet Corner, Duskwood Park. \nThe Umbra Theater has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park, Ironbridge Crossing, Yarrow Plaza, Jasper Marina, Temple Square. \nThe Velvet Corner has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park, Ironbridge Crossing, Yarrow Plaza, Temple Square. \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, Temple Square, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Ironbridge Crossing has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, Temple Square, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina. \nThe Jasper Marina has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Haven Docks, Jasper Marina, Ironbridge Crossing, Yarrow Plaza, Flare Alley, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Shadowbridge Arcade, Willowshade Pavilion, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater, Silvercrest Observatory, Ironbridge Crossing, Flare Alley, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Haven Docks has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater, Silvercrest Observatory, Primrose Boulevard, Gilded Archway, Flare Alley, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Willowshade Pavilion, Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Opal Theater has overlapping signal areas with Primrose Boulevard, Gilded Archway, Beacon Tower, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Copper Clock Square, Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with Primrose Boulevard, Ironbridge Crossing, Gilded Archway, Dragon’s Gate, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Shadowbridge Arcade, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Jasper Marina has overlapping signal areas with Primrose Boulevard, Willowshade Pavilion, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower, Flare Alley, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Willowshade Pavilion, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Ironbridge Crossing has overlapping signal areas with Dragon’s Gate, Flare Alley, Shadowbridge Arcade, Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Dragon’s Gate, Beacon Tower, Flare Alley, Maplewood Conservatory, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion. \nThe Dragon’s Gate has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower, Flare Alley, Copper Clock Square, Maplewood Conservatory, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with Flare Alley, Willowshade Pavilion, Copper Clock Square, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral, Maplewood Conservatory, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Copper Clock Square, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Shadowbridge Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Maplewood Conservatory has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 19 major locations in the city: Mosaic Plaza, Velvet Corner, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Westgate Station, Copper Clock Square, Gilded Archway, Echo Station, Cobalt Market, Willowshade Pavilion, Knight’s Market, Brass Lantern Tavern, Flare Alley, Lighthouse Point, Union Square Market, Amber Plaza, Duskwood Park, Evergreen Circle, Temple Square and Skyline Gardens. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station, Willowshade Pavilion, Flare Alley, Lighthouse Point, Union Square Market, Temple Square. \nThe Velvet Corner has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral, Gilded Archway, Cobalt Market, Flare Alley, Lighthouse Point, Amber Plaza, Duskwood Park, Evergreen Circle, Temple Square, Skyline Gardens. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Westgate Station, Copper Clock Square, Gilded Archway, Echo Station, Knight’s Market, Flare Alley, Union Square Market, Temple Square, Skyline Gardens. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Copper Clock Square, Gilded Archway, Echo Station, Cobalt Market, Knight’s Market, Brass Lantern Tavern, Evergreen Circle. \nThe Copper Clock Square has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Brass Lantern Tavern, Lighthouse Point, Temple Square. \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station, Skyline Gardens. \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Knight’s Market, Lighthouse Point, Duskwood Park, Temple Square, Skyline Gardens. \nThe Cobalt Market has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Lighthouse Point, Union Square Market, Evergreen Circle, Skyline Gardens. \nThe Willowshade Pavilion has overlapping signal areas with Knight’s Market, Flare Alley, Union Square Market, Amber Plaza, Temple Square. \nThe Knight’s Market has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Flare Alley, Union Square Market, Amber Plaza, Duskwood Park. \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with Flare Alley, Union Square Market. \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Amber Plaza. \nThe Lighthouse Point has overlapping signal areas with Union Square Market, Amber Plaza, Duskwood Park, Skyline Gardens. \nThe Union Square Market has overlapping signal areas with Amber Plaza, Evergreen Circle, Temple Square, Skyline Gardens. \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park. \nThe Temple Square has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 19 major locations in the city: Flare Alley, Azure Gardens, Beacon Tower, Jasper Marina, Moonlit Promenade, Dragon’s Gate, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Umbra Theater, Skyline Gardens, Quarry Point, Silvercrest Observatory, Duskwood Park, King’s Row, Maplewood Conservatory, Willowshade Pavilion, Amber Plaza, Horizon Mall, Shadowbridge Arcade and Northwind Tower. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Azure Gardens, Moonlit Promenade, Dragon’s Gate, Skyline Gardens, Silvercrest Observatory, King’s Row, Amber Plaza. \nThe Azure Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina, Moonlit Promenade, Umbra Theater, Skyline Gardens, Duskwood Park, King’s Row. \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina, Dragon’s Gate, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Quarry Point, Silvercrest Observatory, Duskwood Park, Amber Plaza, Horizon Mall. \nThe Jasper Marina has overlapping signal areas with Dragon’s Gate, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Skyline Gardens, Quarry Point, Amber Plaza, Shadowbridge Arcade, Northwind Tower. \nThe Moonlit Promenade has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park, Horizon Mall, Shadowbridge Arcade, Northwind Tower. \nThe Dragon’s Gate has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral, Umbra Theater, King’s Row, Maplewood Conservatory, Horizon Mall, Northwind Tower. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens, Silvercrest Observatory, Willowshade Pavilion, Shadowbridge Arcade, Northwind Tower. \nThe Umbra Theater has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory, Duskwood Park, Horizon Mall. \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Quarry Point, Silvercrest Observatory, Willowshade Pavilion, Horizon Mall, Shadowbridge Arcade. \nThe Quarry Point has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park, King’s Row, Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Maplewood Conservatory, Amber Plaza, Shadowbridge Arcade. \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Maplewood Conservatory, Amber Plaza, Shadowbridge Arcade, Northwind Tower. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Amber Plaza, Horizon Mall. \nThe Maplewood Conservatory has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade, Northwind Tower. \nThe Willowshade Pavilion has overlapping signal areas with Amber Plaza, Horizon Mall, Shadowbridge Arcade. \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower. \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade, Northwind Tower. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 19 major locations in the city: Maplewood Conservatory, Amber Plaza, Lighthouse Point, Granite Plaza, Nimbus Plaza, Rosewood Hall, Pennywhistle Arcade, Lunar Pier, Yarrow Plaza, Shadowbridge Arcade, Opal Theater, Jasper Marina, Copper Clock Square, Gilded Archway, Velvet Corner, Quartz District, Horizon Mall, Temple Square and Oakshade Library. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Maplewood Conservatory has overlapping signal areas with Lighthouse Point, Yarrow Plaza, Shadowbridge Arcade, Opal Theater, Jasper Marina, Gilded Archway, Velvet Corner. \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Lighthouse Point, Granite Plaza, Nimbus Plaza, Shadowbridge Arcade, Jasper Marina, Temple Square, Oakshade Library. \nThe Lighthouse Point has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza, Rosewood Hall, Yarrow Plaza, Shadowbridge Arcade, Horizon Mall, Temple Square, Oakshade Library. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Nimbus Plaza, Rosewood Hall, Pennywhistle Arcade, Shadowbridge Arcade, Jasper Marina, Gilded Archway, Velvet Corner, Oakshade Library. \nThe Nimbus Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade, Lunar Pier, Yarrow Plaza, Velvet Corner. \nThe Rosewood Hall has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade, Shadowbridge Arcade, Opal Theater, Temple Square, Oakshade Library. \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier, Copper Clock Square, Velvet Corner, Quartz District. \nThe Lunar Pier has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater, Velvet Corner, Quartz District, Oakshade Library. \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade, Copper Clock Square, Velvet Corner, Horizon Mall, Temple Square, Oakshade Library. \nThe Shadowbridge Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater, Jasper Marina, Gilded Archway, Horizon Mall. \nThe Opal Theater has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina, Gilded Archway, Velvet Corner, Quartz District. \nThe Jasper Marina has overlapping signal areas with Velvet Corner, Quartz District, Horizon Mall, Temple Square. \nThe Copper Clock Square has overlapping signal areas with Velvet Corner, Quartz District. \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Quartz District. \nThe Velvet Corner has overlapping signal areas with Temple Square, Oakshade Library. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Temple Square. \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Temple Square, Oakshade Library. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 19 major locations in the city: King’s Row, Willowshade Pavilion, Velvet Corner, Gilded Archway, Zenith Arena, Jade Fountain, Union Square Market, Lunar Pier, Sapphire Arena, Evergreen Circle, Beacon Tower, Ironbridge Crossing, Maplewood Conservatory, Duskwood Park, Lighthouse Point, Horizon Mall, Nimbus Plaza, Jasper Marina and Haven Docks. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Gilded Archway, Zenith Arena, Union Square Market, Sapphire Arena, Beacon Tower, Ironbridge Crossing, Maplewood Conservatory, Lighthouse Point, Nimbus Plaza. \nThe Willowshade Pavilion has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway, Jade Fountain, Union Square Market, Sapphire Arena, Beacon Tower, Duskwood Park, Lighthouse Point, Nimbus Plaza, Jasper Marina, Haven Docks. \nThe Velvet Corner has overlapping signal areas with Union Square Market, Lunar Pier, Beacon Tower, Maplewood Conservatory, Lighthouse Point, Horizon Mall, Haven Docks. \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Union Square Market, Beacon Tower, Ironbridge Crossing, Duskwood Park, Lighthouse Point, Jasper Marina. \nThe Zenith Arena has overlapping signal areas with Union Square Market, Sapphire Arena, Evergreen Circle, Ironbridge Crossing, Duskwood Park, Nimbus Plaza. \nThe Jade Fountain has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier, Duskwood Park, Nimbus Plaza. \nThe Union Square Market has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier, Evergreen Circle, Lighthouse Point, Jasper Marina. \nThe Lunar Pier has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena, Beacon Tower, Ironbridge Crossing, Lighthouse Point. \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park, Horizon Mall. \nThe Evergreen Circle has overlapping signal areas with Ironbridge Crossing, Maplewood Conservatory, Jasper Marina. \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Ironbridge Crossing has overlapping signal areas with Lighthouse Point, Horizon Mall, Nimbus Plaza, Jasper Marina, Haven Docks. \nThe Maplewood Conservatory has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park, Haven Docks. \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Lighthouse Point, Horizon Mall, Nimbus Plaza, Jasper Marina. \nThe Lighthouse Point has overlapping signal areas with Nimbus Plaza, Jasper Marina. \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Nimbus Plaza. \nThe Nimbus Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina. \nThe Jasper Marina has overlapping signal areas with Haven Docks. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 19 major locations in the city: Skyline Gardens, Gilded Archway, Zenith Arena, Jasper Marina, Echo Station, Primrose Boulevard, Umbra Theater, Lunar Pier, Brass Lantern Tavern, Westgate Station, Sapphire Arena, Quarry Point, Quartz District, Northwind Tower, Horizon Mall, Granite Plaza, Velvet Corner, Cobalt Market and Maplewood Conservatory. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway, Zenith Arena, Lunar Pier, Brass Lantern Tavern, Granite Plaza, Velvet Corner. \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Zenith Arena, Echo Station, Brass Lantern Tavern, Sapphire Arena, Quarry Point, Quartz District, Granite Plaza, Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Zenith Arena has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina, Primrose Boulevard, Brass Lantern Tavern, Westgate Station, Quarry Point, Velvet Corner, Cobalt Market. \nThe Jasper Marina has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater, Lunar Pier, Westgate Station, Northwind Tower, Velvet Corner, Cobalt Market, Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier, Brass Lantern Tavern, Westgate Station, Sapphire Arena, Quarry Point. \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier, Brass Lantern Tavern, Westgate Station, Sapphire Arena, Quarry Point, Granite Plaza, Velvet Corner, Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Umbra Theater has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier, Westgate Station, Quartz District, Horizon Mall, Velvet Corner. \nThe Lunar Pier has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Westgate Station, Granite Plaza. \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena, Quartz District, Northwind Tower, Granite Plaza, Cobalt Market, Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, Velvet Corner, Cobalt Market. \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with Quartz District, Horizon Mall, Granite Plaza, Velvet Corner. \nThe Quarry Point has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with Horizon Mall, Velvet Corner. \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Velvet Corner, Cobalt Market, Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Velvet Corner. \nThe Velvet Corner has overlapping signal areas with Cobalt Market. \nThe Cobalt Market has overlapping signal areas with Maplewood Conservatory. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 19 major locations in the city: Northwind Tower, Horizon Mall, Azure Gardens, Amber Plaza, Shadowbridge Arcade, Cobalt Market, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Gilded Archway, Evergreen Circle, Pennywhistle Arcade, Brass Lantern Tavern, Lighthouse Point, Union Square Market, Opal Theater, King’s Row, Yarrow Plaza, Temple Square, Copper Clock Square and Sapphire Arena. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with Horizon Mall, Amber Plaza, Shadowbridge Arcade, Cobalt Market, Pennywhistle Arcade, Lighthouse Point, Yarrow Plaza. \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade, Cobalt Market, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Gilded Archway, Pennywhistle Arcade, Brass Lantern Tavern, Lighthouse Point, Opal Theater, King’s Row, Temple Square. \nThe Azure Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Gilded Archway, Evergreen Circle, Pennywhistle Arcade, Brass Lantern Tavern, Lighthouse Point, King’s Row, Yarrow Plaza, Copper Clock Square, Sapphire Arena. \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral, Gilded Archway, Pennywhistle Arcade, Lighthouse Point, Opal Theater, Sapphire Arena. \nThe Shadowbridge Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Evergreen Circle, Brass Lantern Tavern, Lighthouse Point, King’s Row, Copper Clock Square, Sapphire Arena. \nThe Cobalt Market has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway, Evergreen Circle, King’s Row, Yarrow Plaza. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade, Brass Lantern Tavern, Union Square Market, Opal Theater. \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Union Square Market, Opal Theater, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Evergreen Circle has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, Sapphire Arena. \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Lighthouse Point, Union Square Market, King’s Row, Temple Square, Copper Clock Square, Sapphire Arena. \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with Lighthouse Point, Union Square Market, Yarrow Plaza. \nThe Lighthouse Point has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza. \nThe Union Square Market has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Yarrow Plaza, Sapphire Arena. \nThe Opal Theater has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, Copper Clock Square. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Temple Square has overlapping signal areas with Copper Clock Square, Sapphire Arena. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 19 major locations in the city: King’s Row, Moonlit Promenade, Opal Theater, Shadowbridge Arcade, Knight’s Market, Oakshade Library, Nimbus Plaza, Union Square Market, Dragon’s Gate, Quarry Point, Quartz District, Jade Fountain, Echo Station, Beacon Tower, Mosaic Plaza, Rosewood Hall, Temple Square, Skyline Gardens and Copper Clock Square. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Moonlit Promenade, Oakshade Library, Quartz District, Jade Fountain, Beacon Tower, Mosaic Plaza, Rosewood Hall, Skyline Gardens, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Moonlit Promenade has overlapping signal areas with Oakshade Library, Dragon’s Gate, Quartz District, Echo Station, Rosewood Hall, Temple Square. \nThe Opal Theater has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade, Oakshade Library, Union Square Market, Mosaic Plaza, Skyline Gardens. \nThe Shadowbridge Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Knight’s Market, Nimbus Plaza, Beacon Tower, Skyline Gardens, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Knight’s Market has overlapping signal areas with Nimbus Plaza, Quarry Point, Quartz District, Jade Fountain, Echo Station, Skyline Gardens. \nThe Oakshade Library has overlapping signal areas with Dragon’s Gate, Quarry Point, Quartz District, Echo Station, Beacon Tower, Temple Square. \nThe Nimbus Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Jade Fountain, Beacon Tower, Mosaic Plaza, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Union Square Market has overlapping signal areas with Quarry Point, Beacon Tower, Mosaic Plaza, Rosewood Hall, Temple Square, Skyline Gardens, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Dragon’s Gate has overlapping signal areas with Jade Fountain, Echo Station, Rosewood Hall. \nThe Quarry Point has overlapping signal areas with Quartz District, Echo Station, Beacon Tower, Mosaic Plaza, Rosewood Hall, Temple Square. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Jade Fountain has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza, Rosewood Hall. \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza, Rosewood Hall. \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Rosewood Hall, Temple Square, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Rosewood Hall has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens. \nThe Temple Square has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Copper Clock Square. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",
