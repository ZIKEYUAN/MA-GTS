  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 18 major locations in the city: Brass Lantern Tavern, Cobalt Market, Echo Station, Dragon’s Gate, Pennywhistle Arcade, Twilight Harbor, Evergreen Circle, Jasper Marina, Northwind Tower, King’s Row, Nimbus Plaza, Quarry Point, Primrose Boulevard, Granite Plaza, Gilded Archway, Silvercrest Observatory, Flint Forge Quarter and Beacon Tower. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with Cobalt Market, Dragon’s Gate, Pennywhistle Arcade, Twilight Harbor, Northwind Tower, Nimbus Plaza, Granite Plaza, Silvercrest Observatory. \nThe Cobalt Market has overlapping signal areas with Dragon’s Gate, Twilight Harbor, Evergreen Circle, Jasper Marina, King’s Row, Nimbus Plaza, Quarry Point, Granite Plaza, Flint Forge Quarter. \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with Dragon’s Gate, King’s Row, Primrose Boulevard, Granite Plaza, Beacon Tower. \nThe Dragon’s Gate has overlapping signal areas with Evergreen Circle, Northwind Tower, Nimbus Plaza, Quarry Point, Granite Plaza, Gilded Archway. \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Evergreen Circle, Northwind Tower, Quarry Point, Primrose Boulevard, Gilded Archway, Silvercrest Observatory, Flint Forge Quarter. \nThe Twilight Harbor has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina, King’s Row, Nimbus Plaza, Quarry Point, Granite Plaza, Gilded Archway, Flint Forge Quarter, Beacon Tower. \nThe Evergreen Circle has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina, Northwind Tower, Primrose Boulevard, Granite Plaza, Silvercrest Observatory, Beacon Tower. \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Nimbus Plaza, Primrose Boulevard, Granite Plaza. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Flint Forge Quarter, Beacon Tower. \nThe Nimbus Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza, Gilded Archway. \nThe Quarry Point has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory, Beacon Tower. \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Flint Forge Quarter, Beacon Tower. \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with Flint Forge Quarter, Beacon Tower. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 18 major locations in the city: Jade Fountain, Jasper Marina, King’s Row, Flint Forge Quarter, Twilight Harbor, Brass Lantern Tavern, Union Square Market, Mosaic Plaza, Skyline Gardens, Copper Clock Square, Azure Gardens, Westgate Station, Horizon Mall, Oakshade Library, Primrose Boulevard, Shadowbridge Arcade, Moonlit Promenade and Gilded Archway. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Jade Fountain has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Flint Forge Quarter, Twilight Harbor, Brass Lantern Tavern, Union Square Market, Mosaic Plaza, Skyline Gardens, Azure Gardens. \nThe Jasper Marina has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Union Square Market, Mosaic Plaza, Azure Gardens, Oakshade Library, Primrose Boulevard, Moonlit Promenade, Gilded Archway. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Twilight Harbor, Oakshade Library, Shadowbridge Arcade, Gilded Archway. \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza, Azure Gardens, Moonlit Promenade, Gilded Archway. \nThe Twilight Harbor has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Mosaic Plaza, Skyline Gardens, Horizon Mall, Oakshade Library, Primrose Boulevard, Shadowbridge Arcade, Gilded Archway. \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza, Copper Clock Square, Horizon Mall, Shadowbridge Arcade, Gilded Archway. \nThe Union Square Market has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens, Copper Clock Square, Westgate Station, Horizon Mall, Oakshade Library, Shadowbridge Arcade. \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Primrose Boulevard, Shadowbridge Arcade, Moonlit Promenade, Gilded Archway. \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Azure Gardens, Westgate Station. \nThe Copper Clock Square has overlapping signal areas with Westgate Station, Horizon Mall, Shadowbridge Arcade, Gilded Archway. \nThe Azure Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Westgate Station, Shadowbridge Arcade, Moonlit Promenade, Gilded Archway. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Horizon Mall, Shadowbridge Arcade, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade, Moonlit Promenade, Gilded Archway. \nThe Shadowbridge Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference.

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 18 major locations in the city: Haven Docks, Riverstone Wharf, Lighthouse Point, Umbra Theater, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Nimbus Plaza, Silvercrest Observatory, Temple Square, Skyline Gardens, Duskwood Park, Echo Station, King’s Row, Lunar Pier, Quarry Point, Shadowbridge Arcade, Westgate Station, Rosewood Hall and Azure Gardens. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Haven Docks has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Nimbus Plaza, Skyline Gardens, Echo Station, Azure Gardens. \nThe Riverstone Wharf has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory, Skyline Gardens, Duskwood Park, Lunar Pier, Quarry Point, Westgate Station. \nThe Lighthouse Point has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral, Nimbus Plaza, Temple Square, Skyline Gardens, Echo Station, King’s Row, Westgate Station, Azure Gardens. \nThe Umbra Theater has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory, Duskwood Park, Echo Station, Lunar Pier, Quarry Point, Rosewood Hall. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Quarry Point, Westgate Station, Azure Gardens. \nThe Nimbus Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park, Echo Station, King’s Row, Shadowbridge Arcade, Rosewood Hall, Azure Gardens. \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with Quarry Point, Shadowbridge Arcade, Westgate Station. \nThe Temple Square has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station, Quarry Point, Westgate Station, Rosewood Hall. \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier, Quarry Point, Shadowbridge Arcade, Westgate Station, Rosewood Hall, Azure Gardens. \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station, Lunar Pier, Shadowbridge Arcade, Westgate Station, Rosewood Hall. \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Rosewood Hall. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier, Westgate Station. \nThe Lunar Pier has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade, Azure Gardens. \nThe Quarry Point has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade, Westgate Station, Rosewood Hall, Azure Gardens. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Rosewood Hall. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 18 major locations in the city: Horizon Mall, Primrose Boulevard, Skyline Gardens, Brass Lantern Tavern, Willowshade Pavilion, Silvercrest Observatory, Jade Fountain, Lighthouse Point, Temple Square, Oakshade Library, Flare Alley, Granite Plaza, Evergreen Circle, Pennywhistle Arcade, Cobalt Market, Moonlit Promenade, Duskwood Park and Ironbridge Crossing. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens, Willowshade Pavilion, Silvercrest Observatory, Jade Fountain, Lighthouse Point, Oakshade Library, Evergreen Circle, Cobalt Market, Moonlit Promenade, Duskwood Park, Ironbridge Crossing. \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Lighthouse Point, Temple Square, Cobalt Market. \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Willowshade Pavilion, Temple Square, Oakshade Library, Granite Plaza, Evergreen Circle, Cobalt Market. \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Silvercrest Observatory, Temple Square, Oakshade Library, Flare Alley. \nThe Willowshade Pavilion has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory, Oakshade Library, Flare Alley. \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with Jade Fountain, Flare Alley, Granite Plaza, Pennywhistle Arcade, Cobalt Market, Moonlit Promenade, Duskwood Park, Ironbridge Crossing. \nThe Jade Fountain has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza, Evergreen Circle, Duskwood Park, Ironbridge Crossing. \nThe Lighthouse Point has overlapping signal areas with Oakshade Library, Evergreen Circle, Cobalt Market, Duskwood Park. \nThe Temple Square has overlapping signal areas with Evergreen Circle, Pennywhistle Arcade, Moonlit Promenade, Ironbridge Crossing. \nThe Oakshade Library has overlapping signal areas with Flare Alley, Granite Plaza, Pennywhistle Arcade, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Moonlit Promenade, Duskwood Park, Ironbridge Crossing. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Ironbridge Crossing. \nThe Evergreen Circle has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park, Ironbridge Crossing. \nThe Cobalt Market has overlapping signal areas with Ironbridge Crossing. \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Ironbridge Crossing. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 18 major locations in the city: Horizon Mall, Nimbus Plaza, Twilight Harbor, Lunar Pier, Haven Docks, Azure Gardens, King’s Row, Jasper Marina, Sapphire Arena, Umbra Theater, Yarrow Plaza, Westgate Station, Duskwood Park, Oakshade Library, Dragon’s Gate, Opal Theater, Union Square Market and Jade Fountain. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier, Haven Docks, Azure Gardens, Jasper Marina, Westgate Station, Duskwood Park. \nThe Nimbus Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Twilight Harbor, Lunar Pier, Azure Gardens, Yarrow Plaza, Westgate Station, Duskwood Park. \nThe Twilight Harbor has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier, Azure Gardens, Sapphire Arena, Duskwood Park, Oakshade Library, Opal Theater, Union Square Market, Jade Fountain. \nThe Lunar Pier has overlapping signal areas with Haven Docks, Sapphire Arena, Yarrow Plaza, Duskwood Park, Dragon’s Gate, Opal Theater, Union Square Market. \nThe Haven Docks has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina, Sapphire Arena, Umbra Theater, Yarrow Plaza, Westgate Station, Duskwood Park, Oakshade Library, Opal Theater, Union Square Market. \nThe Azure Gardens has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Umbra Theater, Yarrow Plaza, Westgate Station, Dragon’s Gate, Union Square Market, Jade Fountain. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, Union Square Market, Jade Fountain. \nThe Jasper Marina has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, Union Square Market. \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, Oakshade Library, Opal Theater, Jade Fountain. \nThe Umbra Theater has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, Oakshade Library, Dragon’s Gate, Union Square Market. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park, Oakshade Library. \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater, Union Square Market, Jade Fountain. \nThe Oakshade Library has overlapping signal areas with Union Square Market. \nThe Dragon’s Gate has overlapping signal areas with Union Square Market, Jade Fountain. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 18 major locations in the city: Granite Plaza, Skyline Gardens, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Westgate Station, Horizon Mall, Copper Clock Square, Umbra Theater, Oakshade Library, Riverstone Wharf, Echo Station, Brass Lantern Tavern, Moonlit Promenade, Cobalt Market, Lighthouse Point, Quarry Point, Shadowbridge Arcade, Knight’s Market and Lunar Pier. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Horizon Mall, Copper Clock Square, Oakshade Library, Echo Station, Moonlit Promenade, Knight’s Market. \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral, Westgate Station, Umbra Theater, Oakshade Library, Brass Lantern Tavern, Moonlit Promenade, Cobalt Market, Shadowbridge Arcade, Knight’s Market, Lunar Pier. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Moonlit Promenade, Cobalt Market, Shadowbridge Arcade, Lunar Pier. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Horizon Mall, Copper Clock Square, Umbra Theater, Echo Station, Moonlit Promenade, Lighthouse Point, Quarry Point. \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Oakshade Library, Echo Station, Brass Lantern Tavern, Lighthouse Point, Quarry Point, Shadowbridge Arcade. \nThe Copper Clock Square has overlapping signal areas with Riverstone Wharf, Brass Lantern Tavern, Moonlit Promenade, Cobalt Market, Shadowbridge Arcade, Knight’s Market. \nThe Umbra Theater has overlapping signal areas with Moonlit Promenade, Lighthouse Point, Quarry Point. \nThe Oakshade Library has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station, Brass Lantern Tavern, Quarry Point, Shadowbridge Arcade, Knight’s Market. \nThe Riverstone Wharf has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade, Knight’s Market. \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Shadowbridge Arcade. \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with Moonlit Promenade, Shadowbridge Arcade, Lunar Pier. \nThe Moonlit Promenade has overlapping signal areas with Lighthouse Point, Quarry Point, Knight’s Market. \nThe Cobalt Market has overlapping signal areas with Quarry Point. \nThe Lighthouse Point has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier. \nThe Quarry Point has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade. \nThe Shadowbridge Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Knight’s Market. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 18 major locations in the city: Knight’s Market, Horizon Mall, Skyline Gardens, Opal Theater, Oakshade Library, Pennywhistle Arcade, Duskwood Park, King’s Row, Cobalt Market, Nimbus Plaza, Azure Gardens, Copper Clock Square, Moonlit Promenade, Zenith Arena, Flint Forge Quarter, Riverstone Wharf, Brass Lantern Tavern and Velvet Corner. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Knight’s Market has overlapping signal areas with Horizon Mall, Opal Theater, Pennywhistle Arcade, Duskwood Park, Azure Gardens, Copper Clock Square, Moonlit Promenade, Zenith Arena, Flint Forge Quarter, Velvet Corner. \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park, Cobalt Market, Copper Clock Square, Moonlit Promenade, Zenith Arena, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater, Oakshade Library, Cobalt Market, Copper Clock Square, Moonlit Promenade, Zenith Arena, Velvet Corner. \nThe Opal Theater has overlapping signal areas with Oakshade Library, Pennywhistle Arcade, Duskwood Park, Nimbus Plaza, Moonlit Promenade, Flint Forge Quarter, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Oakshade Library has overlapping signal areas with Cobalt Market, Azure Gardens, Copper Clock Square, Moonlit Promenade, Flint Forge Quarter. \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Cobalt Market, Azure Gardens, Copper Clock Square, Riverstone Wharf, Velvet Corner. \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Azure Gardens, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Cobalt Market, Nimbus Plaza, Azure Gardens, Copper Clock Square, Zenith Arena, Flint Forge Quarter, Brass Lantern Tavern, Velvet Corner. \nThe Cobalt Market has overlapping signal areas with Azure Gardens, Zenith Arena. \nThe Nimbus Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Zenith Arena, Flint Forge Quarter, Velvet Corner. \nThe Azure Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Moonlit Promenade, Zenith Arena, Flint Forge Quarter, Velvet Corner. \nThe Copper Clock Square has overlapping signal areas with Flint Forge Quarter, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Moonlit Promenade has overlapping signal areas with Velvet Corner. \nThe Zenith Arena has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Ironbridge Crossing has overlapping signal areas with Haven Docks, Echo Station, Sapphire Arena, Lunar Pier, Willowshade Pavilion, Pennywhistle Arcade, Maplewood Conservatory, Northwind Tower. \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with Velvet Corner, Quarry Point, Sapphire Arena, Skyline Gardens, Pennywhistle Arcade, Temple Square, Northwind Tower. \nThe Velvet Corner has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral, Lunar Pier, King’s Row, Willowshade Pavilion, Temple Square. \nThe Shadowbridge Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral, Quarry Point, Skyline Gardens, Pennywhistle Arcade, Temple Square, Northwind Tower. \nThe Haven Docks has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral, King’s Row. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Flare Alley, King’s Row, Willowshade Pavilion, Temple Square. \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena, Lunar Pier, Temple Square. \nThe Quarry Point has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Skyline Gardens, Willowshade Pavilion, Pennywhistle Arcade, Temple Square, Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Skyline Gardens, Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Lunar Pier has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Skyline Gardens, Willowshade Pavilion, Pennywhistle Arcade, Temple Square, Northwind Tower. \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Temple Square, Maplewood Conservatory, Northwind Tower. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens, Maplewood Conservatory, Northwind Tower. \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Temple Square, Northwind Tower. \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Temple Square, Northwind Tower. \nThe Temple Square has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower. \nThe Maplewood Conservatory has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 18 major locations in the city: Opal Theater, King’s Row, Duskwood Park, Yarrow Plaza, Skyline Gardens, Ironbridge Crossing, Gilded Archway, Horizon Mall, Flint Forge Quarter, Quarry Point, Amber Plaza, Oakshade Library, Primrose Boulevard, Flare Alley, Jasper Marina, Nimbus Plaza, Dragon’s Gate and Sapphire Arena. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Opal Theater has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Yarrow Plaza, Gilded Archway, Horizon Mall, Quarry Point, Oakshade Library, Primrose Boulevard, Sapphire Arena. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens, Gilded Archway, Flint Forge Quarter, Amber Plaza, Primrose Boulevard, Nimbus Plaza, Sapphire Arena. \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, Ironbridge Crossing, Gilded Archway, Oakshade Library, Nimbus Plaza, Dragon’s Gate, Sapphire Arena. \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens, Ironbridge Crossing, Amber Plaza, Oakshade Library, Primrose Boulevard, Nimbus Plaza, Dragon’s Gate, Sapphire Arena. \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Ironbridge Crossing, Gilded Archway, Amber Plaza, Flare Alley, Dragon’s Gate, Sapphire Arena. \nThe Ironbridge Crossing has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway, Horizon Mall, Primrose Boulevard, Flare Alley, Jasper Marina, Nimbus Plaza. \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Flint Forge Quarter. \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Oakshade Library, Flare Alley, Jasper Marina, Nimbus Plaza. \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Amber Plaza, Jasper Marina, Nimbus Plaza. \nThe Quarry Point has overlapping signal areas with Amber Plaza, Jasper Marina. \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Flare Alley, Nimbus Plaza, Dragon’s Gate, Sapphire Arena. \nThe Oakshade Library has overlapping signal areas with Primrose Boulevard, Jasper Marina, Sapphire Arena. \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with Nimbus Plaza, Sapphire Arena. \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina, Nimbus Plaza. \nThe Jasper Marina has overlapping signal areas with Dragon’s Gate. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 18 major locations in the city: Lighthouse Point, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Union Square Market, Rosewood Hall, Jasper Marina, Riverstone Wharf, Amber Plaza, Primrose Boulevard, Granite Plaza, Azure Gardens, Gilded Archway, Flare Alley, Yarrow Plaza, Jade Fountain, Mosaic Plaza, Maplewood Conservatory, Evergreen Circle and Echo Station. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Lighthouse Point has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral, Jasper Marina, Riverstone Wharf, Primrose Boulevard, Azure Gardens, Flare Alley, Jade Fountain. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Union Square Market, Rosewood Hall, Amber Plaza, Gilded Archway, Yarrow Plaza, Mosaic Plaza. \nThe Union Square Market has overlapping signal areas with Primrose Boulevard, Gilded Archway, Jade Fountain, Mosaic Plaza. \nThe Rosewood Hall has overlapping signal areas with Riverstone Wharf, Primrose Boulevard, Granite Plaza, Gilded Archway, Flare Alley, Mosaic Plaza, Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Jasper Marina has overlapping signal areas with Riverstone Wharf, Flare Alley, Jade Fountain, Mosaic Plaza. \nThe Riverstone Wharf has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza, Gilded Archway, Flare Alley, Yarrow Plaza. \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Primrose Boulevard, Granite Plaza, Azure Gardens, Yarrow Plaza, Jade Fountain, Maplewood Conservatory, Evergreen Circle, Echo Station. \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with Maplewood Conservatory, Echo Station. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Azure Gardens, Flare Alley, Yarrow Plaza, Jade Fountain, Mosaic Plaza, Evergreen Circle, Echo Station. \nThe Azure Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Flare Alley, Maplewood Conservatory, Echo Station. \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza, Maplewood Conservatory, Echo Station. \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Jade Fountain, Evergreen Circle, Echo Station. \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Jade Fountain, Mosaic Plaza. \nThe Jade Fountain has overlapping signal areas with Maplewood Conservatory, Evergreen Circle. \nThe Maplewood Conservatory has overlapping signal areas with Evergreen Circle, Echo Station. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 18 major locations in the city: Riverstone Wharf, Union Square Market, Yarrow Plaza, Gilded Archway, Umbra Theater, Granite Plaza, Quartz District, Temple Square, Velvet Corner, Echo Station, Azure Gardens, Rosewood Hall, Twilight Harbor, Silvercrest Observatory, Opal Theater, Lighthouse Point, Flint Forge Quarter and Westgate Station. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Riverstone Wharf has overlapping signal areas with Union Square Market, Gilded Archway, Granite Plaza, Quartz District, Twilight Harbor, Silvercrest Observatory, Opal Theater. \nThe Union Square Market has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, Umbra Theater, Granite Plaza, Temple Square, Echo Station, Rosewood Hall, Flint Forge Quarter, Westgate Station. \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway, Umbra Theater, Quartz District, Temple Square, Echo Station, Rosewood Hall, Silvercrest Observatory, Lighthouse Point. \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Quartz District, Velvet Corner, Echo Station, Rosewood Hall, Opal Theater. \nThe Umbra Theater has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza, Temple Square, Echo Station, Twilight Harbor, Opal Theater, Lighthouse Point. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Temple Square, Echo Station, Rosewood Hall, Flint Forge Quarter, Westgate Station. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Temple Square, Velvet Corner, Azure Gardens, Flint Forge Quarter, Westgate Station. \nThe Temple Square has overlapping signal areas with Velvet Corner, Azure Gardens, Rosewood Hall, Silvercrest Observatory. \nThe Velvet Corner has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory, Opal Theater. \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory, Flint Forge Quarter. \nThe Azure Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Twilight Harbor, Silvercrest Observatory, Lighthouse Point, Westgate Station. \nThe Rosewood Hall has overlapping signal areas with Twilight Harbor, Silvercrest Observatory. \nThe Twilight Harbor has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory, Opal Theater, Lighthouse Point. \nThe Opal Theater has overlapping signal areas with Westgate Station. \nThe Lighthouse Point has overlapping signal areas with Flint Forge Quarter. \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Westgate Station. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 18 major locations in the city: Evergreen Circle, Flint Forge Quarter, Silvercrest Observatory, Willowshade Pavilion, Yarrow Plaza, Umbra Theater, Northwind Tower, Duskwood Park, Westgate Station, Flare Alley, Moonlit Promenade, Quartz District, Granite Plaza, Amber Plaza, Quarry Point, Echo Station, Riverstone Wharf and Jade Fountain. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Evergreen Circle has overlapping signal areas with Flint Forge Quarter, Yarrow Plaza, Flare Alley. \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory, Willowshade Pavilion, Northwind Tower, Duskwood Park, Westgate Station, Amber Plaza, Quarry Point, Echo Station, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Yarrow Plaza, Flare Alley, Moonlit Promenade, Quartz District, Quarry Point, Riverstone Wharf, Jade Fountain. \nThe Willowshade Pavilion has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, Northwind Tower, Moonlit Promenade, Quarry Point, Echo Station. \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater, Duskwood Park, Quartz District, Granite Plaza, Amber Plaza, Echo Station. \nThe Umbra Theater has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, Flare Alley, Echo Station. \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with Moonlit Promenade, Quartz District, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Flare Alley, Amber Plaza, Echo Station, Jade Fountain. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Flare Alley, Moonlit Promenade, Quartz District, Granite Plaza, Quarry Point, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station, Riverstone Wharf, Jade Fountain. \nThe Moonlit Promenade has overlapping signal areas with Quartz District, Granite Plaza, Riverstone Wharf, Jade Fountain. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station, Riverstone Wharf, Jade Fountain. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Amber Plaza, Quarry Point, Jade Fountain. \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Quarry Point. \nThe Quarry Point has overlapping signal areas with Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with Jade Fountain. \nThe Riverstone Wharf has overlapping signal areas with Jade Fountain. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 18 major locations in the city: Beacon Tower, Skyline Gardens, Horizon Mall, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Temple Square, Silvercrest Observatory, Westgate Station, Riverstone Wharf, Knight’s Market, Nimbus Plaza, Velvet Corner, Lunar Pier, Amber Plaza, Ironbridge Crossing, Primrose Boulevard, Echo Station, Jasper Marina and Azure Gardens. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens, Horizon Mall, Temple Square, Silvercrest Observatory, Westgate Station, Riverstone Wharf, Nimbus Plaza, Velvet Corner, Amber Plaza, Primrose Boulevard, Echo Station. \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Horizon Mall, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Riverstone Wharf, Velvet Corner, Azure Gardens. \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral, Westgate Station, Riverstone Wharf, Knight’s Market, Velvet Corner, Lunar Pier, Ironbridge Crossing, Primrose Boulevard, Echo Station, Jasper Marina. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory, Knight’s Market, Azure Gardens. \nThe Temple Square has overlapping signal areas with Westgate Station, Nimbus Plaza, Velvet Corner, Primrose Boulevard, Azure Gardens. \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with Knight’s Market, Nimbus Plaza, Velvet Corner, Lunar Pier, Amber Plaza, Jasper Marina. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Knight’s Market, Nimbus Plaza, Jasper Marina, Azure Gardens. \nThe Riverstone Wharf has overlapping signal areas with Ironbridge Crossing. \nThe Knight’s Market has overlapping signal areas with Ironbridge Crossing, Echo Station, Jasper Marina, Azure Gardens. \nThe Nimbus Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Velvet Corner has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier, Ironbridge Crossing, Primrose Boulevard, Jasper Marina. \nThe Lunar Pier has overlapping signal areas with Amber Plaza, Ironbridge Crossing. \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Primrose Boulevard, Azure Gardens. \nThe Ironbridge Crossing has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station, Azure Gardens. \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station. \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina, Azure Gardens. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference.

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 18 major locations in the city: Velvet Corner, Cobalt Market, Shadowbridge Arcade, Gilded Archway, Northwind Tower, Skyline Gardens, Ironbridge Crossing, Knight’s Market, Opal Theater, Quartz District, Twilight Harbor, Lunar Pier, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Union Square Market, Zenith Arena, Beacon Tower, Flint Forge Quarter and Quarry Point. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Velvet Corner has overlapping signal areas with Cobalt Market, Shadowbridge Arcade, Gilded Archway, Skyline Gardens, Ironbridge Crossing, Opal Theater, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Flint Forge Quarter. \nThe Cobalt Market has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens, Ironbridge Crossing, Knight’s Market, Quartz District, Zenith Arena, Quarry Point. \nThe Shadowbridge Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, Skyline Gardens, Ironbridge Crossing, Knight’s Market, Opal Theater, Twilight Harbor, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Union Square Market, Flint Forge Quarter. \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Knight’s Market, Opal Theater, Twilight Harbor, Lunar Pier, Zenith Arena, Flint Forge Quarter. \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens, Knight’s Market, Lunar Pier, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater, Quartz District, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Quarry Point. \nThe Ironbridge Crossing has overlapping signal areas with Knight’s Market, Quartz District, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Beacon Tower, Flint Forge Quarter, Quarry Point. \nThe Knight’s Market has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater, Lunar Pier, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Union Square Market, Zenith Arena. \nThe Opal Theater has overlapping signal areas with Quartz District, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Twilight Harbor. \nThe Twilight Harbor has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier, Union Square Market. \nThe Lunar Pier has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral, Union Square Market, Beacon Tower. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Zenith Arena, Beacon Tower, Quarry Point. \nThe Union Square Market has overlapping signal areas with Zenith Arena, Flint Forge Quarter, Quarry Point. \nThe Zenith Arena has overlapping signal areas with Flint Forge Quarter. \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with Flint Forge Quarter. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade, Duskwood Park, Rosewood Hall. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Flint Forge Quarter, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Ironbridge Crossing, Oakshade Library, Knight’s Market, Riverstone Wharf, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Moonlit Promenade has overlapping signal areas with Ironbridge Crossing, Oakshade Library, Pennywhistle Arcade, Gilded Archway, Duskwood Park, Riverstone Wharf, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Ironbridge Crossing, Zenith Arena, Knight’s Market, Gilded Archway, Duskwood Park, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with Zenith Arena, Knight’s Market, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Oakshade Library, Haven Docks, Echo Station. \nThe Ironbridge Crossing has overlapping signal areas with Haven Docks, Gilded Archway, Duskwood Park, Riverstone Wharf, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Oakshade Library has overlapping signal areas with Haven Docks, Zenith Arena, Pennywhistle Arcade, Gilded Archway, Echo Station, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Haven Docks has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade, Knight’s Market, Rosewood Hall. \nThe Zenith Arena has overlapping signal areas with Knight’s Market, Echo Station, Duskwood Park, Riverstone Wharf, Rosewood Hall, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Knight’s Market has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway, Echo Station, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station, Duskwood Park, Rosewood Hall. \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park, Rosewood Hall, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Riverstone Wharf, Rosewood Hall, Primrose Boulevard. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 18 major locations in the city: Gilded Archway, Primrose Boulevard, Haven Docks, Sapphire Arena, Amber Plaza, Knight’s Market, Ironbridge Crossing, Quarry Point, Rosewood Hall, Silvercrest Observatory, Yarrow Plaza, Willowshade Pavilion, King’s Row, Lighthouse Point, Velvet Corner, Westgate Station, Cobalt Market and Horizon Mall. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Knight’s Market, Ironbridge Crossing, Quarry Point, Rosewood Hall, Yarrow Plaza, King’s Row, Velvet Corner. \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with Haven Docks, Amber Plaza, Ironbridge Crossing, Quarry Point, Rosewood Hall, Silvercrest Observatory, King’s Row, Velvet Corner, Westgate Station, Cobalt Market, Horizon Mall. \nThe Haven Docks has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena, Ironbridge Crossing, Quarry Point, Silvercrest Observatory, Yarrow Plaza, Velvet Corner, Westgate Station. \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with Quarry Point, Rosewood Hall, Silvercrest Observatory, Lighthouse Point, Westgate Station. \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Rosewood Hall, Silvercrest Observatory, King’s Row, Lighthouse Point. \nThe Knight’s Market has overlapping signal areas with Ironbridge Crossing, Quarry Point, Silvercrest Observatory, Willowshade Pavilion, Velvet Corner, Cobalt Market. \nThe Ironbridge Crossing has overlapping signal areas with Rosewood Hall, Yarrow Plaza, Willowshade Pavilion, Horizon Mall. \nThe Quarry Point has overlapping signal areas with Rosewood Hall, Willowshade Pavilion, Lighthouse Point, Velvet Corner, Cobalt Market, Horizon Mall. \nThe Rosewood Hall has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory, Yarrow Plaza, Willowshade Pavilion, Westgate Station. \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with Lighthouse Point, Westgate Station, Cobalt Market, Horizon Mall. \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Westgate Station, Cobalt Market. \nThe Willowshade Pavilion has overlapping signal areas with Westgate Station. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Velvet Corner. \nThe Lighthouse Point has overlapping signal areas with Horizon Mall. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Cobalt Market. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 18 major locations in the city: Umbra Theater, Amber Plaza, Knight’s Market, Ironbridge Crossing, Copper Clock Square, Lighthouse Point, Silvercrest Observatory, Westgate Station, Echo Station, Riverstone Wharf, Duskwood Park, Opal Theater, Northwind Tower, Willowshade Pavilion, Pennywhistle Arcade, Twilight Harbor, Brass Lantern Tavern and Quarry Point. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Umbra Theater has overlapping signal areas with Knight’s Market, Copper Clock Square, Lighthouse Point, Silvercrest Observatory, Westgate Station, Echo Station, Opal Theater, Twilight Harbor. \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Ironbridge Crossing, Willowshade Pavilion, Brass Lantern Tavern, Quarry Point. \nThe Knight’s Market has overlapping signal areas with Lighthouse Point, Silvercrest Observatory, Echo Station, Riverstone Wharf, Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Ironbridge Crossing has overlapping signal areas with Lighthouse Point, Echo Station, Riverstone Wharf, Duskwood Park. \nThe Copper Clock Square has overlapping signal areas with Lighthouse Point, Silvercrest Observatory, Westgate Station, Riverstone Wharf, Opal Theater, Northwind Tower, Pennywhistle Arcade, Twilight Harbor, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Lighthouse Point has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory, Duskwood Park, Willowshade Pavilion, Pennywhistle Arcade, Twilight Harbor. \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station, Duskwood Park, Pennywhistle Arcade, Twilight Harbor, Quarry Point. \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with Riverstone Wharf, Willowshade Pavilion, Pennywhistle Arcade, Twilight Harbor, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Riverstone Wharf has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park, Opal Theater, Northwind Tower, Pennywhistle Arcade, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Opal Theater has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade, Twilight Harbor, Quarry Point. \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Pennywhistle Arcade, Twilight Harbor. \nThe Willowshade Pavilion has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade, Twilight Harbor, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Quarry Point. \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with Quarry Point. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

The network will cover 18 major locations in the city: Pennywhistle Arcade, Azure Gardens, Knight’s Market, Horizon Mall, Haven Docks, Skyline Gardens, Northwind Tower, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Flint Forge Quarter, Riverstone Wharf, Willowshade Pavilion, Cobalt Market, Lighthouse Point, Beacon Tower, Ironbridge Crossing, Brass Lantern Tavern, Zenith Arena and Jasper Marina. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Riverstone Wharf, Cobalt Market, Lighthouse Point, Beacon Tower, Ironbridge Crossing, Zenith Arena, Jasper Marina. \nThe Azure Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Horizon Mall, Northwind Tower, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Flint Forge Quarter, Riverstone Wharf, Lighthouse Point, Beacon Tower, Brass Lantern Tavern, Jasper Marina. \nThe Knight’s Market has overlapping signal areas with Haven Docks, Northwind Tower, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Flint Forge Quarter, Cobalt Market, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Haven Docks, Skyline Gardens, Riverstone Wharf, Beacon Tower, Brass Lantern Tavern, Jasper Marina. \nThe Haven Docks has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Cobalt Market, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, Riverstone Wharf, Lighthouse Point, Brass Lantern Tavern, Zenith Arena. \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with Flint Forge Quarter, Willowshade Pavilion, Brass Lantern Tavern, Zenith Arena, Jasper Marina. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Lighthouse Point, Beacon Tower, Jasper Marina. \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Beacon Tower, Ironbridge Crossing, Zenith Arena, Jasper Marina. \nThe Riverstone Wharf has overlapping signal areas with Lighthouse Point, Ironbridge Crossing, Zenith Arena. \nThe Willowshade Pavilion has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower. \nThe Cobalt Market has overlapping signal areas with Lighthouse Point. \nThe Lighthouse Point has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower, Ironbridge Crossing, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with Ironbridge Crossing, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Ironbridge Crossing has overlapping signal areas with Zenith Arena, Jasper Marina. \nThe Zenith Arena has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 18 major locations in the city: Flare Alley, Cobalt Market, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Moonlit Promenade, Quartz District, Yarrow Plaza, Evergreen Circle, Maplewood Conservatory, Haven Docks, Echo Station, Lighthouse Point, Flint Forge Quarter, Jade Fountain, Dragon’s Gate, Primrose Boulevard, Silvercrest Observatory, Northwind Tower and Pennywhistle Arcade. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas.

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 18 major locations in the city: Union Square Market, Copper Clock Square, Granite Plaza, Beacon Tower, Brass Lantern Tavern, Westgate Station, Dragon’s Gate, Primrose Boulevard, Azure Gardens, Temple Square, Twilight Harbor, Lighthouse Point, Silvercrest Observatory, Pennywhistle Arcade, Sapphire Arena, Oakshade Library, Riverstone Wharf and Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Union Square Market has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower, Westgate Station, Dragon’s Gate, Oakshade Library, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Copper Clock Square has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza, Beacon Tower, Brass Lantern Tavern, Westgate Station, Dragon’s Gate, Azure Gardens, Temple Square, Twilight Harbor, Lighthouse Point, Silvercrest Observatory, Pennywhistle Arcade, Sapphire Arena. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Primrose Boulevard, Temple Square, Lighthouse Point, Sapphire Arena, Oakshade Library. \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Azure Gardens, Twilight Harbor, Lighthouse Point, Silvercrest Observatory, Oakshade Library, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with Westgate Station, Temple Square, Sapphire Arena, Oakshade Library. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Dragon’s Gate, Azure Gardens, Temple Square, Twilight Harbor, Lighthouse Point, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Dragon’s Gate has overlapping signal areas with Temple Square, Lighthouse Point, Silvercrest Observatory, Oakshade Library. \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with Lighthouse Point, Silvercrest Observatory, Sapphire Arena. \nThe Azure Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory, Pennywhistle Arcade, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Temple Square has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade, Oakshade Library, Riverstone Wharf, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Twilight Harbor has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena, Oakshade Library, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Lighthouse Point has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory, Sapphire Arena, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with Oakshade Library, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Oakshade Library. \nThe Riverstone Wharf has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 18 major locations in the city: Quartz District, Evergreen Circle, Union Square Market, Westgate Station, Zenith Arena, Horizon Mall, Shadowbridge Arcade, Quarry Point, Amber Plaza, Knight’s Market, Moonlit Promenade, Flint Forge Quarter, Nimbus Plaza, Lighthouse Point, Brass Lantern Tavern, Cobalt Market, Beacon Tower and Opal Theater. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Evergreen Circle, Zenith Arena, Shadowbridge Arcade, Moonlit Promenade, Brass Lantern Tavern, Cobalt Market. \nThe Evergreen Circle has overlapping signal areas with Quarry Point, Amber Plaza, Brass Lantern Tavern, Opal Theater. \nThe Union Square Market has overlapping signal areas with Zenith Arena, Quarry Point, Moonlit Promenade, Nimbus Plaza, Brass Lantern Tavern, Cobalt Market, Beacon Tower. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Zenith Arena, Amber Plaza, Knight’s Market, Moonlit Promenade, Brass Lantern Tavern, Opal Theater. \nThe Zenith Arena has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade, Quarry Point, Amber Plaza, Knight’s Market, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Amber Plaza, Knight’s Market, Moonlit Promenade, Cobalt Market, Beacon Tower, Opal Theater. \nThe Shadowbridge Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Amber Plaza, Knight’s Market, Nimbus Plaza, Lighthouse Point, Brass Lantern Tavern, Beacon Tower, Opal Theater. \nThe Quarry Point has overlapping signal areas with Moonlit Promenade, Lighthouse Point, Beacon Tower. \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Knight’s Market, Flint Forge Quarter, Lighthouse Point, Brass Lantern Tavern, Beacon Tower, Opal Theater. \nThe Knight’s Market has overlapping signal areas with Moonlit Promenade, Flint Forge Quarter, Nimbus Plaza, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Moonlit Promenade has overlapping signal areas with Lighthouse Point, Brass Lantern Tavern, Beacon Tower, Opal Theater. \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Lighthouse Point, Beacon Tower. \nThe Nimbus Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Cobalt Market. \nThe Lighthouse Point has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater. \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater. \nThe Cobalt Market has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 18 major locations in the city: Primrose Boulevard, Copper Clock Square, Lunar Pier, Granite Plaza, Moonlit Promenade, Quarry Point, Flint Forge Quarter, Silvercrest Observatory, Nimbus Plaza, Sapphire Arena, Yarrow Plaza, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Lighthouse Point, Rosewood Hall, Duskwood Park, Beacon Tower, Ironbridge Crossing and Temple Square. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with Copper Clock Square, Lunar Pier, Granite Plaza, Moonlit Promenade, Yarrow Plaza, Rosewood Hall, Duskwood Park, Beacon Tower, Temple Square. \nThe Copper Clock Square has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza, Moonlit Promenade, Quarry Point, Silvercrest Observatory, Nimbus Plaza, Sapphire Arena, Lighthouse Point, Duskwood Park, Ironbridge Crossing, Temple Square. \nThe Lunar Pier has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza, Quarry Point, Sapphire Arena, Lighthouse Point, Ironbridge Crossing. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Flint Forge Quarter, Silvercrest Observatory, Nimbus Plaza, Sapphire Arena, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Duskwood Park, Ironbridge Crossing. \nThe Moonlit Promenade has overlapping signal areas with Flint Forge Quarter, Sapphire Arena, Lighthouse Point, Rosewood Hall, Beacon Tower, Temple Square. \nThe Quarry Point has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory, Nimbus Plaza, Rosewood Hall, Duskwood Park. \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena, Yarrow Plaza, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with Nimbus Plaza, Lighthouse Point, Rosewood Hall, Duskwood Park. \nThe Nimbus Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena, Lighthouse Point, Temple Square. \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park, Ironbridge Crossing, Temple Square. \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Rosewood Hall, Duskwood Park. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Lighthouse Point, Beacon Tower, Temple Square. \nThe Rosewood Hall has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park, Temple Square. \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Temple Square. \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with Temple Square. \nThe Ironbridge Crossing has overlapping signal areas with Temple Square. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",
