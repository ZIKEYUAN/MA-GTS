  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 23 major locations in the city: Lighthouse Point, Northwind Tower, Nimbus Plaza, Dragon’s Gate, Mosaic Plaza, Willowshade Pavilion, Umbra Theater, Zenith Arena, Cobalt Market, Brass Lantern Tavern, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Sapphire Arena, Evergreen Circle, Skyline Gardens, Granite Plaza, Rosewood Hall, Oakshade Library, Pennywhistle Arcade, Silvercrest Observatory, Twilight Harbor, Yarrow Plaza, Primrose Boulevard and Horizon Mall. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Lighthouse Point has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, Dragon’s Gate, Mosaic Plaza, Zenith Arena, Cobalt Market, Skyline Gardens, Rosewood Hall, Horizon Mall. \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza, Willowshade Pavilion, Umbra Theater, Zenith Arena, Sapphire Arena, Evergreen Circle, Rosewood Hall, Oakshade Library, Silvercrest Observatory, Yarrow Plaza, Primrose Boulevard, Horizon Mall. \nThe Nimbus Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Dragon’s Gate, Mosaic Plaza, Umbra Theater, Cobalt Market, Brass Lantern Tavern, Oakshade Library, Twilight Harbor, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Dragon’s Gate has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Umbra Theater, Zenith Arena, Brass Lantern Tavern, Granite Plaza, Twilight Harbor, Yarrow Plaza, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Zenith Arena, Sapphire Arena, Skyline Gardens, Granite Plaza, Rosewood Hall, Yarrow Plaza, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Willowshade Pavilion has overlapping signal areas with Cobalt Market, Brass Lantern Tavern, Evergreen Circle, Granite Plaza, Rosewood Hall, Oakshade Library, Pennywhistle Arcade, Yarrow Plaza, Horizon Mall. \nThe Umbra Theater has overlapping signal areas with Zenith Arena, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Granite Plaza, Oakshade Library, Pennywhistle Arcade, Silvercrest Observatory. \nThe Zenith Arena has overlapping signal areas with Cobalt Market, Brass Lantern Tavern, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Rosewood Hall, Pennywhistle Arcade, Yarrow Plaza, Primrose Boulevard, Horizon Mall. \nThe Cobalt Market has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Skyline Gardens, Rosewood Hall, Pennywhistle Arcade, Silvercrest Observatory, Yarrow Plaza. \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral, Evergreen Circle, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena, Oakshade Library, Horizon Mall. \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with Evergreen Circle, Pennywhistle Arcade, Silvercrest Observatory, Yarrow Plaza. \nThe Evergreen Circle has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza, Twilight Harbor, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza, Rosewood Hall, Silvercrest Observatory, Twilight Harbor, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Rosewood Hall, Oakshade Library, Pennywhistle Arcade, Silvercrest Observatory, Yarrow Plaza. \nThe Rosewood Hall has overlapping signal areas with Twilight Harbor, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory, Yarrow Plaza, Horizon Mall. \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with Twilight Harbor, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Twilight Harbor has overlapping signal areas with Primrose Boulevard. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 23 major locations in the city: Pennywhistle Arcade, Opal Theater, Lighthouse Point, Sapphire Arena, Jasper Marina, Temple Square, Quarry Point, Northwind Tower, Flare Alley, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Velvet Corner, Willowshade Pavilion, Beacon Tower, Riverstone Wharf, King’s Row, Haven Docks, Dragon’s Gate, Knight’s Market, Brass Lantern Tavern, Mosaic Plaza, Amber Plaza, Quartz District and Azure Gardens. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater, Lighthouse Point, Sapphire Arena, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Willowshade Pavilion, Riverstone Wharf, King’s Row, Brass Lantern Tavern, Mosaic Plaza, Amber Plaza. \nThe Opal Theater has overlapping signal areas with Quarry Point, Willowshade Pavilion, Riverstone Wharf, King’s Row, Knight’s Market, Brass Lantern Tavern, Mosaic Plaza, Quartz District. \nThe Lighthouse Point has overlapping signal areas with Temple Square, Northwind Tower, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Riverstone Wharf, Knight’s Market, Mosaic Plaza, Amber Plaza, Azure Gardens. \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with Temple Square, Northwind Tower, Flare Alley, Willowshade Pavilion, Beacon Tower, Brass Lantern Tavern, Mosaic Plaza, Amber Plaza, Quartz District. \nThe Jasper Marina has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, King’s Row, Mosaic Plaza, Azure Gardens. \nThe Temple Square has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower, Riverstone Wharf, King’s Row, Quartz District, Azure Gardens. \nThe Quarry Point has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, Ivory Spire Cathedral, King’s Row, Knight’s Market, Brass Lantern Tavern, Mosaic Plaza, Quartz District, Azure Gardens. \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral, Velvet Corner, Beacon Tower, Knight’s Market, Mosaic Plaza, Quartz District. \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral, Riverstone Wharf, Haven Docks, Dragon’s Gate, Knight’s Market, Brass Lantern Tavern, Amber Plaza, Quartz District. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, King’s Row, Brass Lantern Tavern, Amber Plaza. \nThe Velvet Corner has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Riverstone Wharf, King’s Row, Haven Docks, Knight’s Market, Brass Lantern Tavern, Quartz District, Azure Gardens. \nThe Willowshade Pavilion has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower, Mosaic Plaza. \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with Dragon’s Gate, Amber Plaza, Azure Gardens. \nThe Riverstone Wharf has overlapping signal areas with Haven Docks, Dragon’s Gate, Knight’s Market, Brass Lantern Tavern, Mosaic Plaza. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Haven Docks, Brass Lantern Tavern, Mosaic Plaza. \nThe Haven Docks has overlapping signal areas with Dragon’s Gate, Knight’s Market, Quartz District, Azure Gardens. \nThe Dragon’s Gate has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Mosaic Plaza, Amber Plaza, Quartz District. \nThe Knight’s Market has overlapping signal areas with Amber Plaza, Azure Gardens. \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with Quartz District. \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Amber Plaza, Azure Gardens. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Azure Gardens. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 23 major locations in the city: Amber Plaza, Flare Alley, Granite Plaza, Brass Lantern Tavern, Westgate Station, Moonlit Promenade, Knight’s Market, Union Square Market, Skyline Gardens, Flint Forge Quarter, Quartz District, Riverstone Wharf, Pennywhistle Arcade, Echo Station, Sapphire Arena, Duskwood Park, Temple Square, Northwind Tower, Lighthouse Point, Quarry Point, Nimbus Plaza, Rosewood Hall and Zenith Arena. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Union Square Market, Flint Forge Quarter, Riverstone Wharf, Northwind Tower. \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Westgate Station, Knight’s Market, Riverstone Wharf, Pennywhistle Arcade, Sapphire Arena, Temple Square, Lighthouse Point, Quarry Point. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Knight’s Market, Flint Forge Quarter, Quartz District, Riverstone Wharf, Pennywhistle Arcade, Temple Square, Northwind Tower, Nimbus Plaza, Zenith Arena. \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with Moonlit Promenade, Knight’s Market, Union Square Market, Skyline Gardens, Quartz District, Riverstone Wharf, Echo Station, Sapphire Arena, Zenith Arena. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Union Square Market, Quartz District, Pennywhistle Arcade, Duskwood Park, Lighthouse Point, Quarry Point, Nimbus Plaza, Rosewood Hall, Zenith Arena. \nThe Moonlit Promenade has overlapping signal areas with Union Square Market, Quarry Point. \nThe Knight’s Market has overlapping signal areas with Flint Forge Quarter, Quartz District, Echo Station, Duskwood Park, Northwind Tower, Quarry Point, Nimbus Plaza, Rosewood Hall, Zenith Arena. \nThe Union Square Market has overlapping signal areas with Flint Forge Quarter, Pennywhistle Arcade, Echo Station, Duskwood Park, Northwind Tower, Nimbus Plaza, Rosewood Hall, Zenith Arena. \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade, Echo Station, Sapphire Arena, Duskwood Park, Quarry Point, Rosewood Hall. \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena, Northwind Tower, Lighthouse Point, Quarry Point, Nimbus Plaza. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade, Sapphire Arena, Temple Square, Northwind Tower. \nThe Riverstone Wharf has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade, Echo Station, Sapphire Arena, Quarry Point, Nimbus Plaza, Zenith Arena. \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Nimbus Plaza, Rosewood Hall, Zenith Arena. \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park, Northwind Tower, Nimbus Plaza. \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with Temple Square, Quarry Point, Rosewood Hall, Zenith Arena. \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, Lighthouse Point, Rosewood Hall, Zenith Arena. \nThe Temple Square has overlapping signal areas with Quarry Point, Nimbus Plaza. \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with Quarry Point, Nimbus Plaza, Rosewood Hall. \nThe Lighthouse Point has overlapping signal areas with Quarry Point, Zenith Arena. \nThe Quarry Point has overlapping signal areas with Nimbus Plaza, Rosewood Hall. \nThe Nimbus Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Zenith Arena. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 23 major locations in the city: Flare Alley, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Willowshade Pavilion, Lunar Pier, Granite Plaza, Quarry Point, Quartz District, Silvercrest Observatory, Flint Forge Quarter, Brass Lantern Tavern, Copper Clock Square, Jade Fountain, Ironbridge Crossing, Nimbus Plaza, Knight’s Market, Oakshade Library, Azure Gardens, Northwind Tower, Pennywhistle Arcade, Beacon Tower, Mosaic Plaza, Velvet Corner and Union Square Market. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Lunar Pier, Brass Lantern Tavern, Ironbridge Crossing, Oakshade Library, Pennywhistle Arcade, Mosaic Plaza, Union Square Market. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Lunar Pier, Quarry Point, Quartz District, Silvercrest Observatory, Copper Clock Square, Ironbridge Crossing, Nimbus Plaza, Knight’s Market, Oakshade Library, Azure Gardens, Northwind Tower, Beacon Tower, Mosaic Plaza, Velvet Corner. \nThe Willowshade Pavilion has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza, Quarry Point, Quartz District, Brass Lantern Tavern, Copper Clock Square, Ironbridge Crossing, Azure Gardens, Pennywhistle Arcade, Beacon Tower, Mosaic Plaza, Velvet Corner, Union Square Market. \nThe Lunar Pier has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory, Flint Forge Quarter, Jade Fountain, Ironbridge Crossing, Oakshade Library, Beacon Tower, Velvet Corner, Union Square Market. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Jade Fountain, Ironbridge Crossing, Knight’s Market, Northwind Tower, Beacon Tower, Velvet Corner. \nThe Quarry Point has overlapping signal areas with Flint Forge Quarter, Brass Lantern Tavern, Jade Fountain, Oakshade Library, Pennywhistle Arcade, Beacon Tower. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory, Brass Lantern Tavern, Jade Fountain, Mosaic Plaza, Velvet Corner. \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with Jade Fountain, Ironbridge Crossing, Knight’s Market, Beacon Tower. \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Jade Fountain, Azure Gardens, Pennywhistle Arcade, Beacon Tower, Velvet Corner, Union Square Market. \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with Ironbridge Crossing, Knight’s Market, Northwind Tower, Pennywhistle Arcade, Mosaic Plaza, Velvet Corner. \nThe Copper Clock Square has overlapping signal areas with Jade Fountain, Northwind Tower. \nThe Jade Fountain has overlapping signal areas with Ironbridge Crossing, Oakshade Library, Mosaic Plaza. \nThe Ironbridge Crossing has overlapping signal areas with Nimbus Plaza, Oakshade Library, Azure Gardens, Beacon Tower. \nThe Nimbus Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Knight’s Market, Oakshade Library, Azure Gardens, Northwind Tower, Pennywhistle Arcade, Beacon Tower, Mosaic Plaza, Union Square Market. \nThe Knight’s Market has overlapping signal areas with Oakshade Library, Azure Gardens, Northwind Tower, Mosaic Plaza. \nThe Oakshade Library has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, Mosaic Plaza. \nThe Azure Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, Beacon Tower. \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower, Velvet Corner. \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with Union Square Market. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 23 major locations in the city: Westgate Station, Dragon’s Gate, Northwind Tower, Moonlit Promenade, Mosaic Plaza, Jasper Marina, Willowshade Pavilion, Sapphire Arena, Twilight Harbor, Haven Docks, Brass Lantern Tavern, Yarrow Plaza, Gilded Archway, Zenith Arena, Ironbridge Crossing, Pennywhistle Arcade, Temple Square, Primrose Boulevard, King’s Row, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Skyline Gardens, Quartz District and Silvercrest Observatory. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Dragon’s Gate, Jasper Marina, Willowshade Pavilion, Brass Lantern Tavern, Gilded Archway, Pennywhistle Arcade, Temple Square, Primrose Boulevard, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Skyline Gardens. \nThe Dragon’s Gate has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, Mosaic Plaza, Willowshade Pavilion, Sapphire Arena, Gilded Archway, Pennywhistle Arcade, Temple Square, King’s Row, Skyline Gardens, Silvercrest Observatory. \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza, Jasper Marina, Willowshade Pavilion, Sapphire Arena, Yarrow Plaza, Temple Square, Primrose Boulevard, Quartz District, Silvercrest Observatory. \nThe Moonlit Promenade has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza, Twilight Harbor, Zenith Arena, Ironbridge Crossing, Pennywhistle Arcade, Temple Square, Quartz District, Silvercrest Observatory. \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Twilight Harbor, Brass Lantern Tavern, Ironbridge Crossing, Temple Square, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Silvercrest Observatory. \nThe Jasper Marina has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Twilight Harbor, Gilded Archway, Pennywhistle Arcade, Temple Square, Primrose Boulevard, King’s Row, Silvercrest Observatory. \nThe Willowshade Pavilion has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena, Yarrow Plaza, Zenith Arena, Pennywhistle Arcade, Temple Square, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Zenith Arena, Temple Square, King’s Row, Silvercrest Observatory. \nThe Twilight Harbor has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, Zenith Arena, Pennywhistle Arcade, Primrose Boulevard, King’s Row, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Haven Docks has overlapping signal areas with Temple Square, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Quartz District. \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, Gilded Archway, Pennywhistle Arcade, Temple Square, Skyline Gardens, Silvercrest Observatory. \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Skyline Gardens. \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Zenith Arena, Quartz District. \nThe Zenith Arena has overlapping signal areas with Ironbridge Crossing, Temple Square, Primrose Boulevard, Quartz District, Silvercrest Observatory. \nThe Ironbridge Crossing has overlapping signal areas with Primrose Boulevard, King’s Row, Skyline Gardens. \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Temple Square, Quartz District, Silvercrest Observatory. \nThe Temple Square has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Skyline Gardens, Quartz District, Silvercrest Observatory. \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral, Skyline Gardens. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral, Skyline Gardens, Quartz District, Silvercrest Observatory. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 23 major locations in the city: Velvet Corner, Ironbridge Crossing, Dragon’s Gate, Opal Theater, Mosaic Plaza, Lunar Pier, Westgate Station, Zenith Arena, Quartz District, Granite Plaza, Flint Forge Quarter, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Beacon Tower, Willowshade Pavilion, Union Square Market, Maplewood Conservatory, Azure Gardens, Sapphire Arena, Gilded Archway, Shadowbridge Arcade, Moonlit Promenade, King’s Row and Yarrow Plaza. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Velvet Corner has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza, Lunar Pier, Westgate Station, Quartz District, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Beacon Tower, Union Square Market, Gilded Archway, King’s Row, Yarrow Plaza. \nThe Ironbridge Crossing has overlapping signal areas with Dragon’s Gate, Opal Theater, Union Square Market, Maplewood Conservatory, Gilded Archway, Moonlit Promenade, King’s Row, Yarrow Plaza. \nThe Dragon’s Gate has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza, Granite Plaza, Flint Forge Quarter, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Willowshade Pavilion, Union Square Market, Maplewood Conservatory, Azure Gardens, Gilded Archway, Shadowbridge Arcade. \nThe Opal Theater has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier, Westgate Station, Granite Plaza, Flint Forge Quarter, Beacon Tower, Willowshade Pavilion, Maplewood Conservatory, Azure Gardens, Sapphire Arena. \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Westgate Station, Zenith Arena, Quartz District, Granite Plaza, Willowshade Pavilion, Yarrow Plaza. \nThe Lunar Pier has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Willowshade Pavilion, Sapphire Arena, Shadowbridge Arcade, Yarrow Plaza. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Zenith Arena, Quartz District, Willowshade Pavilion, Azure Gardens, King’s Row, Yarrow Plaza. \nThe Zenith Arena has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza, Flint Forge Quarter, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Beacon Tower, Willowshade Pavilion, Maplewood Conservatory, Shadowbridge Arcade, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral, Beacon Tower, Union Square Market, Azure Gardens, Gilded Archway, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Flint Forge Quarter, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Willowshade Pavilion, Gilded Archway, Moonlit Promenade, King’s Row, Yarrow Plaza. \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Union Square Market, Shadowbridge Arcade, King’s Row. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Maplewood Conservatory, Gilded Archway, Shadowbridge Arcade. \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with Union Square Market, Maplewood Conservatory, Azure Gardens, Sapphire Arena, Moonlit Promenade, King’s Row, Yarrow Plaza. \nThe Willowshade Pavilion has overlapping signal areas with Azure Gardens, Sapphire Arena, Yarrow Plaza. \nThe Union Square Market has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Maplewood Conservatory has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade, Moonlit Promenade, King’s Row. \nThe Azure Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway, Moonlit Promenade, Yarrow Plaza. \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with Moonlit Promenade, King’s Row, Yarrow Plaza. \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Shadowbridge Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Moonlit Promenade. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 23 major locations in the city: Westgate Station, Umbra Theater, Azure Gardens, Flare Alley, Amber Plaza, Jasper Marina, Lighthouse Point, Nimbus Plaza, Riverstone Wharf, Rosewood Hall, Granite Plaza, Horizon Mall, Mosaic Plaza, Gilded Archway, Union Square Market, Primrose Boulevard, Maplewood Conservatory, King’s Row, Yarrow Plaza, Knight’s Market, Shadowbridge Arcade, Echo Station and Copper Clock Square. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater, Flare Alley, Nimbus Plaza, Riverstone Wharf, Rosewood Hall, Mosaic Plaza, Gilded Archway, Union Square Market, Maplewood Conservatory, King’s Row, Knight’s Market, Shadowbridge Arcade. \nThe Umbra Theater has overlapping signal areas with Flare Alley, Amber Plaza, Jasper Marina, Lighthouse Point, Nimbus Plaza, Riverstone Wharf, Rosewood Hall, Union Square Market, Primrose Boulevard, Maplewood Conservatory, King’s Row, Knight’s Market, Echo Station. \nThe Azure Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Lighthouse Point, Rosewood Hall, Horizon Mall, Mosaic Plaza, Union Square Market, King’s Row, Knight’s Market, Shadowbridge Arcade, Echo Station. \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Amber Plaza, Jasper Marina, Rosewood Hall, Mosaic Plaza, King’s Row, Yarrow Plaza, Knight’s Market, Shadowbridge Arcade. \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza, Horizon Mall, Mosaic Plaza, Primrose Boulevard, Maplewood Conservatory, King’s Row, Echo Station, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Jasper Marina has overlapping signal areas with Nimbus Plaza, Rosewood Hall, Mosaic Plaza, Gilded Archway, Union Square Market, Maplewood Conservatory, Knight’s Market, Echo Station. \nThe Lighthouse Point has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza, Union Square Market, King’s Row, Yarrow Plaza. \nThe Nimbus Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade. \nThe Riverstone Wharf has overlapping signal areas with Rosewood Hall, Granite Plaza, Shadowbridge Arcade, Echo Station, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Rosewood Hall has overlapping signal areas with Horizon Mall, Union Square Market, Primrose Boulevard, Maplewood Conservatory, King’s Row, Yarrow Plaza, Shadowbridge Arcade, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza, Primrose Boulevard, King’s Row, Yarrow Plaza, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway, Maplewood Conservatory, King’s Row, Shadowbridge Arcade, Echo Station. \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Maplewood Conservatory, Knight’s Market, Shadowbridge Arcade, Echo Station. \nThe Union Square Market has overlapping signal areas with Primrose Boulevard, King’s Row, Shadowbridge Arcade, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Maplewood Conservatory has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Shadowbridge Arcade, Echo Station. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, Shadowbridge Arcade. \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade, Echo Station, Copper Clock Square. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 23 major locations in the city: Quarry Point, Mosaic Plaza, Copper Clock Square, Amber Plaza, Haven Docks, Lunar Pier, Azure Gardens, Willowshade Pavilion, Dragon’s Gate, Union Square Market, Rosewood Hall, Westgate Station, Ironbridge Crossing, Flare Alley, Twilight Harbor, Yarrow Plaza, Maplewood Conservatory, Quartz District, Flint Forge Quarter, Beacon Tower, Moonlit Promenade, Velvet Corner and Cobalt Market. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Quarry Point has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza, Amber Plaza, Haven Docks, Azure Gardens, Rosewood Hall, Westgate Station, Ironbridge Crossing, Flare Alley, Twilight Harbor, Maplewood Conservatory, Flint Forge Quarter, Beacon Tower, Cobalt Market. \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Amber Plaza, Azure Gardens, Union Square Market, Rosewood Hall, Westgate Station, Ironbridge Crossing, Flare Alley, Maplewood Conservatory, Moonlit Promenade, Velvet Corner, Cobalt Market. \nThe Copper Clock Square has overlapping signal areas with Amber Plaza, Dragon’s Gate, Ironbridge Crossing, Flare Alley, Flint Forge Quarter. \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Union Square Market, Flare Alley, Yarrow Plaza, Maplewood Conservatory, Quartz District, Velvet Corner. \nThe Haven Docks has overlapping signal areas with Azure Gardens, Dragon’s Gate, Union Square Market, Rosewood Hall, Flare Alley, Velvet Corner, Cobalt Market. \nThe Lunar Pier has overlapping signal areas with Westgate Station, Yarrow Plaza, Maplewood Conservatory, Quartz District, Beacon Tower, Velvet Corner. \nThe Azure Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Union Square Market, Quartz District. \nThe Willowshade Pavilion has overlapping signal areas with Union Square Market, Westgate Station, Ironbridge Crossing, Twilight Harbor, Beacon Tower, Cobalt Market. \nThe Dragon’s Gate has overlapping signal areas with Flare Alley, Twilight Harbor, Yarrow Plaza, Maplewood Conservatory, Quartz District. \nThe Union Square Market has overlapping signal areas with Rosewood Hall, Westgate Station, Ironbridge Crossing, Flare Alley, Yarrow Plaza, Beacon Tower, Velvet Corner. \nThe Rosewood Hall has overlapping signal areas with Westgate Station, Ironbridge Crossing, Yarrow Plaza, Quartz District, Flint Forge Quarter, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Quartz District, Beacon Tower, Moonlit Promenade, Cobalt Market. \nThe Ironbridge Crossing has overlapping signal areas with Flare Alley, Twilight Harbor, Yarrow Plaza, Quartz District, Velvet Corner, Cobalt Market. \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Quartz District, Flint Forge Quarter, Beacon Tower. \nThe Twilight Harbor has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, Maplewood Conservatory, Flint Forge Quarter, Beacon Tower, Velvet Corner. \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Maplewood Conservatory, Quartz District, Flint Forge Quarter, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Maplewood Conservatory has overlapping signal areas with Velvet Corner, Cobalt Market. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Moonlit Promenade, Cobalt Market. \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower, Moonlit Promenade, Cobalt Market. \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with Moonlit Promenade. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

The network will cover 23 major locations in the city: Moonlit Promenade, Lunar Pier, Granite Plaza, Willowshade Pavilion, Twilight Harbor, Zenith Arena, Knight’s Market, Beacon Tower, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Maplewood Conservatory, Evergreen Circle, Primrose Boulevard, Horizon Mall, Copper Clock Square, Westgate Station, Opal Theater, Azure Gardens, Brass Lantern Tavern, Amber Plaza, Duskwood Park, Jasper Marina, Lighthouse Point and Quarry Point. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Moonlit Promenade has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier, Granite Plaza, Beacon Tower, Evergreen Circle, Copper Clock Square, Opal Theater, Azure Gardens, Brass Lantern Tavern, Duskwood Park, Jasper Marina, Lighthouse Point, Quarry Point. \nThe Lunar Pier has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Twilight Harbor, Zenith Arena, Beacon Tower, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Evergreen Circle, Primrose Boulevard, Copper Clock Square, Opal Theater, Lighthouse Point, Quarry Point. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Beacon Tower, Maplewood Conservatory, Evergreen Circle, Primrose Boulevard, Copper Clock Square, Brass Lantern Tavern, Lighthouse Point. \nThe Willowshade Pavilion has overlapping signal areas with Knight’s Market, Beacon Tower, Maplewood Conservatory, Westgate Station, Opal Theater, Brass Lantern Tavern, Duskwood Park, Lighthouse Point, Quarry Point. \nThe Twilight Harbor has overlapping signal areas with Zenith Arena, Maplewood Conservatory, Horizon Mall, Copper Clock Square, Duskwood Park, Quarry Point. \nThe Zenith Arena has overlapping signal areas with Primrose Boulevard, Copper Clock Square, Opal Theater, Azure Gardens, Amber Plaza, Duskwood Park, Jasper Marina. \nThe Knight’s Market has overlapping signal areas with Evergreen Circle, Horizon Mall, Azure Gardens, Brass Lantern Tavern, Lighthouse Point. \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with Evergreen Circle, Primrose Boulevard, Opal Theater, Azure Gardens, Amber Plaza, Duskwood Park, Lighthouse Point, Quarry Point. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Evergreen Circle, Primrose Boulevard, Horizon Mall, Brass Lantern Tavern, Amber Plaza, Jasper Marina. \nThe Maplewood Conservatory has overlapping signal areas with Horizon Mall, Westgate Station, Opal Theater. \nThe Evergreen Circle has overlapping signal areas with Primrose Boulevard, Jasper Marina, Quarry Point. \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with Horizon Mall, Copper Clock Square, Opal Theater, Duskwood Park. \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Azure Gardens, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Copper Clock Square has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater, Amber Plaza, Lighthouse Point. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater, Jasper Marina, Quarry Point. \nThe Opal Theater has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Amber Plaza, Lighthouse Point. \nThe Azure Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Amber Plaza, Duskwood Park, Lighthouse Point. \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park, Quarry Point. \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park, Quarry Point. \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina, Quarry Point. \nThe Jasper Marina has overlapping signal areas with Lighthouse Point, Quarry Point. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference.

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 23 major locations in the city: Nimbus Plaza, Horizon Mall, Knight’s Market, Northwind Tower, Umbra Theater, Mosaic Plaza, Dragon’s Gate, Temple Square, Haven Docks, Pennywhistle Arcade, Duskwood Park, Brass Lantern Tavern, Rosewood Hall, Amber Plaza, Jasper Marina, Willowshade Pavilion, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Quarry Point, Sapphire Arena, Granite Plaza, Silvercrest Observatory, Yarrow Plaza and Jade Fountain. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Nimbus Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Horizon Mall, Knight’s Market, Northwind Tower, Haven Docks, Duskwood Park, Brass Lantern Tavern, Jasper Marina, Willowshade Pavilion, Jade Fountain. \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Knight’s Market, Temple Square, Pennywhistle Arcade, Brass Lantern Tavern, Amber Plaza. \nThe Knight’s Market has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza, Duskwood Park, Amber Plaza, Jasper Marina, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Silvercrest Observatory, Jade Fountain. \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with Temple Square, Haven Docks, Pennywhistle Arcade, Willowshade Pavilion, Sapphire Arena, Granite Plaza, Yarrow Plaza. \nThe Umbra Theater has overlapping signal areas with Dragon’s Gate, Haven Docks, Brass Lantern Tavern, Rosewood Hall, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Granite Plaza, Silvercrest Observatory, Jade Fountain. \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Dragon’s Gate, Haven Docks, Quarry Point, Granite Plaza, Silvercrest Observatory, Jade Fountain. \nThe Dragon’s Gate has overlapping signal areas with Temple Square, Duskwood Park, Rosewood Hall, Jasper Marina, Willowshade Pavilion, Granite Plaza, Silvercrest Observatory, Jade Fountain. \nThe Temple Square has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade, Duskwood Park, Brass Lantern Tavern, Amber Plaza, Willowshade Pavilion, Sapphire Arena, Granite Plaza, Silvercrest Observatory, Yarrow Plaza, Jade Fountain. \nThe Haven Docks has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade, Duskwood Park, Brass Lantern Tavern, Rosewood Hall, Willowshade Pavilion, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Quarry Point, Jade Fountain. \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Quarry Point, Granite Plaza. \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Amber Plaza, Jasper Marina, Willowshade Pavilion, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Quarry Point, Yarrow Plaza, Jade Fountain. \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with Rosewood Hall, Jasper Marina, Granite Plaza. \nThe Rosewood Hall has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Sapphire Arena, Yarrow Plaza. \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Sapphire Arena, Silvercrest Observatory, Yarrow Plaza. \nThe Jasper Marina has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Quarry Point, Sapphire Arena, Yarrow Plaza. \nThe Willowshade Pavilion has overlapping signal areas with Quarry Point, Silvercrest Observatory. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Quarry Point, Granite Plaza, Silvercrest Observatory, Yarrow Plaza. \nThe Quarry Point has overlapping signal areas with Jade Fountain. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza. \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, Jade Fountain. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 23 major locations in the city: Twilight Harbor, Mosaic Plaza, Dragon’s Gate, Yarrow Plaza, Quartz District, Temple Square, Pennywhistle Arcade, Jade Fountain, Moonlit Promenade, Nimbus Plaza, Quarry Point, Skyline Gardens, Duskwood Park, Lighthouse Point, Cobalt Market, Westgate Station, Haven Docks, Willowshade Pavilion, King’s Row, Evergreen Circle, Oakshade Library, Brass Lantern Tavern and Northwind Tower. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Twilight Harbor has overlapping signal areas with Quartz District, Moonlit Promenade, Haven Docks, Willowshade Pavilion, Evergreen Circle, Oakshade Library. \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Dragon’s Gate, Pennywhistle Arcade, Nimbus Plaza, Skyline Gardens, Evergreen Circle. \nThe Dragon’s Gate has overlapping signal areas with Temple Square, Pennywhistle Arcade, Moonlit Promenade, Skyline Gardens, Cobalt Market, King’s Row, Oakshade Library, Brass Lantern Tavern, Northwind Tower. \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade, Moonlit Promenade, Duskwood Park, Lighthouse Point, Cobalt Market, Westgate Station, King’s Row, Oakshade Library, Northwind Tower. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Temple Square, Quarry Point, Duskwood Park, Lighthouse Point, Cobalt Market, Westgate Station, Brass Lantern Tavern, Northwind Tower. \nThe Temple Square has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade, Duskwood Park, Lighthouse Point, Westgate Station, Haven Docks, Willowshade Pavilion, Evergreen Circle, Oakshade Library. \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Jade Fountain, Nimbus Plaza, Quarry Point, Skyline Gardens, Duskwood Park, Lighthouse Point, Haven Docks, Willowshade Pavilion, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Jade Fountain has overlapping signal areas with Nimbus Plaza, Duskwood Park, Lighthouse Point, Haven Docks, Willowshade Pavilion, King’s Row, Evergreen Circle, Northwind Tower. \nThe Moonlit Promenade has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens, Duskwood Park, Lighthouse Point, Westgate Station, Haven Docks, Willowshade Pavilion, Oakshade Library. \nThe Nimbus Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Quarry Point, Skyline Gardens, Duskwood Park, Cobalt Market, Haven Docks, Willowshade Pavilion, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Quarry Point has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park, Lighthouse Point, Cobalt Market, Willowshade Pavilion, King’s Row, Brass Lantern Tavern, Northwind Tower. \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park, King’s Row, Northwind Tower. \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Oakshade Library. \nThe Lighthouse Point has overlapping signal areas with Cobalt Market, Westgate Station, Haven Docks, Willowshade Pavilion, Oakshade Library. \nThe Cobalt Market has overlapping signal areas with Westgate Station, Willowshade Pavilion, King’s Row. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Evergreen Circle, Northwind Tower. \nThe Haven Docks has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, King’s Row. \nThe Willowshade Pavilion has overlapping signal areas with Oakshade Library. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Oakshade Library, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 23 major locations in the city: Willowshade Pavilion, Zenith Arena, Dragon’s Gate, Evergreen Circle, Umbra Theater, Primrose Boulevard, Velvet Corner, Duskwood Park, Granite Plaza, Horizon Mall, Nimbus Plaza, Silvercrest Observatory, Sapphire Arena, Temple Square, Northwind Tower, Oakshade Library, Riverstone Wharf, Jasper Marina, Lighthouse Point, Skyline Gardens, Westgate Station, Gilded Archway and Knight’s Market. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Willowshade Pavilion has overlapping signal areas with Zenith Arena, Primrose Boulevard, Temple Square, Northwind Tower, Westgate Station. \nThe Zenith Arena has overlapping signal areas with Evergreen Circle, Umbra Theater, Nimbus Plaza, Sapphire Arena, Northwind Tower, Oakshade Library, Skyline Gardens. \nThe Dragon’s Gate has overlapping signal areas with Evergreen Circle, Umbra Theater, Granite Plaza, Horizon Mall, Silvercrest Observatory, Temple Square, Northwind Tower, Oakshade Library, Riverstone Wharf, Lighthouse Point, Skyline Gardens. \nThe Evergreen Circle has overlapping signal areas with Primrose Boulevard, Nimbus Plaza, Oakshade Library, Jasper Marina, Westgate Station, Gilded Archway. \nThe Umbra Theater has overlapping signal areas with Primrose Boulevard, Duskwood Park, Nimbus Plaza, Jasper Marina, Lighthouse Point, Skyline Gardens. \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with Nimbus Plaza, Silvercrest Observatory, Northwind Tower, Oakshade Library, Riverstone Wharf, Knight’s Market. \nThe Velvet Corner has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park, Horizon Mall, Nimbus Plaza, Sapphire Arena, Temple Square, Northwind Tower, Jasper Marina, Lighthouse Point, Skyline Gardens, Westgate Station, Knight’s Market. \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza, Nimbus Plaza, Sapphire Arena, Temple Square, Riverstone Wharf, Westgate Station, Gilded Archway. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Horizon Mall, Nimbus Plaza, Temple Square, Oakshade Library, Jasper Marina, Lighthouse Point, Gilded Archway. \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Nimbus Plaza, Riverstone Wharf, Jasper Marina, Skyline Gardens. \nThe Nimbus Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory, Sapphire Arena, Oakshade Library, Lighthouse Point, Knight’s Market. \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with Oakshade Library, Jasper Marina. \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with Temple Square, Northwind Tower, Oakshade Library, Riverstone Wharf, Jasper Marina. \nThe Temple Square has overlapping signal areas with Riverstone Wharf, Jasper Marina, Lighthouse Point, Skyline Gardens, Westgate Station, Gilded Archway, Knight’s Market. \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina, Lighthouse Point. \nThe Oakshade Library has overlapping signal areas with Riverstone Wharf, Jasper Marina, Lighthouse Point, Westgate Station, Gilded Archway, Knight’s Market. \nThe Riverstone Wharf has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens, Westgate Station, Knight’s Market. \nThe Jasper Marina has overlapping signal areas with Lighthouse Point. \nThe Lighthouse Point has overlapping signal areas with Westgate Station, Knight’s Market. \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Knight’s Market. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Knight’s Market. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 23 major locations in the city: Moonlit Promenade, Brass Lantern Tavern, Duskwood Park, King’s Row, Westgate Station, Ironbridge Crossing, Amber Plaza, Nimbus Plaza, Rosewood Hall, Yarrow Plaza, Twilight Harbor, Gilded Archway, Mosaic Plaza, Horizon Mall, Beacon Tower, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Northwind Tower, Pennywhistle Arcade, Flare Alley, Jasper Marina, Umbra Theater, Maplewood Conservatory and Lighthouse Point. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Moonlit Promenade has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Westgate Station, Rosewood Hall, Yarrow Plaza, Twilight Harbor, Beacon Tower, Northwind Tower, Flare Alley, Jasper Marina, Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with Amber Plaza, Nimbus Plaza, Rosewood Hall, Northwind Tower, Umbra Theater, Lighthouse Point. \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Ironbridge Crossing, Rosewood Hall, Gilded Archway, Mosaic Plaza, Pennywhistle Arcade, Flare Alley, Jasper Marina. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Amber Plaza, Twilight Harbor, Gilded Archway, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Northwind Tower, Pennywhistle Arcade, Jasper Marina, Umbra Theater, Maplewood Conservatory, Lighthouse Point. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Rosewood Hall, Gilded Archway, Beacon Tower, Pennywhistle Arcade, Lighthouse Point. \nThe Ironbridge Crossing has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, Mosaic Plaza, Horizon Mall, Jasper Marina, Umbra Theater, Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Nimbus Plaza, Rosewood Hall, Yarrow Plaza, Twilight Harbor, Flare Alley, Umbra Theater, Maplewood Conservatory, Lighthouse Point. \nThe Nimbus Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Rosewood Hall, Gilded Archway, Horizon Mall, Beacon Tower, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Flare Alley. \nThe Rosewood Hall has overlapping signal areas with Twilight Harbor, Mosaic Plaza, Horizon Mall, Beacon Tower, Northwind Tower, Lighthouse Point. \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza, Horizon Mall, Beacon Tower, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Pennywhistle Arcade, Jasper Marina. \nThe Twilight Harbor has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza, Horizon Mall, Beacon Tower, Northwind Tower, Umbra Theater, Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Northwind Tower, Pennywhistle Arcade, Umbra Theater, Lighthouse Point. \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral, Northwind Tower, Pennywhistle Arcade, Jasper Marina, Umbra Theater, Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade. \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina, Umbra Theater. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade, Umbra Theater, Maplewood Conservatory, Lighthouse Point. \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with Flare Alley, Umbra Theater, Lighthouse Point. \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina, Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater, Maplewood Conservatory, Lighthouse Point. \nThe Jasper Marina has overlapping signal areas with Maplewood Conservatory, Lighthouse Point. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Shadowbridge Arcade, Granite Plaza, Westgate Station, Cobalt Market, Echo Station, Lunar Pier, Horizon Mall, Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza, Temple Square, Westgate Station, Skyline Gardens, Cobalt Market, Silvercrest Observatory, Azure Gardens, Riverstone Wharf, Union Square Market. \nThe Willowshade Pavilion has overlapping signal areas with Quarry Point, Shadowbridge Arcade, Silvercrest Observatory, Azure Gardens, Opal Theater, Echo Station, Lunar Pier. \nThe Quarry Point has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade, Granite Plaza, Westgate Station, Twilight Harbor, Silvercrest Observatory, Echo Station, Horizon Mall, Riverstone Wharf, Union Square Market. \nThe Shadowbridge Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Temple Square, Skyline Gardens, Cobalt Market, Twilight Harbor, Silvercrest Observatory, Copper Clock Square, Horizon Mall, Riverstone Wharf, Maplewood Conservatory, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Temple Square, Skyline Gardens, Twilight Harbor, Silvercrest Observatory, Azure Gardens, Opal Theater, Echo Station, Horizon Mall, Riverstone Wharf, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Temple Square has overlapping signal areas with Westgate Station, Skyline Gardens, Opal Theater, Echo Station, Riverstone Wharf, Union Square Market, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory, Riverstone Wharf, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Cobalt Market, Twilight Harbor, Silvercrest Observatory, Azure Gardens, Lunar Pier, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier, Horizon Mall, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Cobalt Market has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory, Opal Theater, Copper Clock Square, Lunar Pier, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Twilight Harbor has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory, Azure Gardens, Copper Clock Square, Lunar Pier. \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater, Lunar Pier, Horizon Mall, Maplewood Conservatory, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Azure Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Copper Clock Square, Lunar Pier, Riverstone Wharf, Maplewood Conservatory, Union Square Market. \nThe Opal Theater has overlapping signal areas with Union Square Market. \nThe Copper Clock Square has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station, Lunar Pier, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with Horizon Mall, Union Square Market, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Lunar Pier has overlapping signal areas with Union Square Market, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Union Square Market, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Riverstone Wharf has overlapping signal areas with Maplewood Conservatory, Primrose Boulevard. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 23 major locations in the city: Primrose Boulevard, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Moonlit Promenade, Northwind Tower, Brass Lantern Tavern, Jade Fountain, Skyline Gardens, Temple Square, Oakshade Library, Gilded Archway, Evergreen Circle, Mosaic Plaza, Quarry Point, Cobalt Market, Union Square Market, Lunar Pier, Granite Plaza, Copper Clock Square, Duskwood Park, Flint Forge Quarter, Yarrow Plaza, Dragon’s Gate and Ironbridge Crossing. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral, Moonlit Promenade, Jade Fountain, Oakshade Library, Mosaic Plaza, Union Square Market, Granite Plaza, Copper Clock Square, Flint Forge Quarter, Yarrow Plaza, Dragon’s Gate. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Moonlit Promenade, Jade Fountain, Skyline Gardens, Oakshade Library, Evergreen Circle, Mosaic Plaza, Quarry Point, Union Square Market, Granite Plaza, Duskwood Park, Dragon’s Gate. \nThe Moonlit Promenade has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Skyline Gardens, Cobalt Market, Lunar Pier, Duskwood Park. \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Jade Fountain, Temple Square, Mosaic Plaza, Quarry Point, Cobalt Market, Lunar Pier, Yarrow Plaza, Dragon’s Gate. \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with Temple Square, Oakshade Library, Gilded Archway, Mosaic Plaza, Copper Clock Square, Flint Forge Quarter. \nThe Jade Fountain has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens, Temple Square, Mosaic Plaza, Granite Plaza, Copper Clock Square, Flint Forge Quarter, Dragon’s Gate, Ironbridge Crossing. \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Temple Square, Oakshade Library, Gilded Archway, Evergreen Circle, Cobalt Market, Union Square Market, Lunar Pier, Copper Clock Square, Duskwood Park, Flint Forge Quarter, Dragon’s Gate. \nThe Temple Square has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza, Granite Plaza, Flint Forge Quarter. \nThe Oakshade Library has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway, Evergreen Circle, Mosaic Plaza, Quarry Point, Lunar Pier, Duskwood Park, Dragon’s Gate, Ironbridge Crossing. \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Evergreen Circle, Mosaic Plaza, Granite Plaza, Duskwood Park, Flint Forge Quarter, Ironbridge Crossing. \nThe Evergreen Circle has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza, Union Square Market, Lunar Pier, Duskwood Park, Yarrow Plaza. \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Quarry Point. \nThe Quarry Point has overlapping signal areas with Union Square Market, Lunar Pier. \nThe Cobalt Market has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza, Dragon’s Gate. \nThe Union Square Market has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park, Dragon’s Gate. \nThe Lunar Pier has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza, Duskwood Park, Flint Forge Quarter, Yarrow Plaza. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park, Yarrow Plaza, Ironbridge Crossing. \nThe Copper Clock Square has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park. \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, Dragon’s Gate. \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, Ironbridge Crossing. \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Dragon’s Gate, Ironbridge Crossing. \nThe Dragon’s Gate has overlapping signal areas with Ironbridge Crossing. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 23 major locations in the city: Nimbus Plaza, Rosewood Hall, Silvercrest Observatory, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Quarry Point, Velvet Corner, Brass Lantern Tavern, Amber Plaza, Flare Alley, Yarrow Plaza, Opal Theater, Beacon Tower, Oakshade Library, Primrose Boulevard, Westgate Station, Jade Fountain, Duskwood Park, Moonlit Promenade, Jasper Marina, Knight’s Market, Ironbridge Crossing, Dragon’s Gate and Echo Station. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Nimbus Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Westgate Station, Jade Fountain, Jasper Marina, Knight’s Market. \nThe Rosewood Hall has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral, Quarry Point, Brass Lantern Tavern, Yarrow Plaza, Opal Theater, Beacon Tower, Ironbridge Crossing. \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral, Quarry Point, Velvet Corner, Brass Lantern Tavern, Yarrow Plaza, Opal Theater, Beacon Tower, Primrose Boulevard, Westgate Station, Duskwood Park. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Velvet Corner, Brass Lantern Tavern, Flare Alley, Westgate Station, Moonlit Promenade, Jasper Marina, Dragon’s Gate. \nThe Quarry Point has overlapping signal areas with Amber Plaza, Flare Alley, Yarrow Plaza, Oakshade Library, Primrose Boulevard, Westgate Station, Moonlit Promenade, Echo Station. \nThe Velvet Corner has overlapping signal areas with Amber Plaza, Opal Theater, Oakshade Library, Duskwood Park, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with Flare Alley, Opal Theater, Beacon Tower, Primrose Boulevard, Jade Fountain, Jasper Marina, Ironbridge Crossing, Dragon’s Gate. \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, Primrose Boulevard, Westgate Station, Moonlit Promenade, Jasper Marina, Echo Station. \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, Opal Theater, Oakshade Library, Jade Fountain, Moonlit Promenade, Dragon’s Gate. \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater, Oakshade Library, Primrose Boulevard, Jade Fountain, Knight’s Market, Ironbridge Crossing, Dragon’s Gate. \nThe Opal Theater has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower, Westgate Station, Duskwood Park, Moonlit Promenade, Jasper Marina, Knight’s Market, Dragon’s Gate. \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with Jade Fountain, Duskwood Park, Moonlit Promenade, Ironbridge Crossing. \nThe Oakshade Library has overlapping signal areas with Jade Fountain, Moonlit Promenade, Knight’s Market, Dragon’s Gate. \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with Jade Fountain, Duskwood Park, Moonlit Promenade, Knight’s Market, Ironbridge Crossing. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Jade Fountain, Duskwood Park, Ironbridge Crossing. \nThe Jade Fountain has overlapping signal areas with Knight’s Market, Dragon’s Gate, Echo Station. \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Moonlit Promenade, Ironbridge Crossing, Dragon’s Gate, Echo Station. \nThe Moonlit Promenade has overlapping signal areas with Ironbridge Crossing, Echo Station. \nThe Jasper Marina has overlapping signal areas with Dragon’s Gate. \nThe Knight’s Market has overlapping signal areas with Ironbridge Crossing, Dragon’s Gate. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 23 major locations in the city: Quartz District, Granite Plaza, Gilded Archway, Horizon Mall, Ironbridge Crossing, Shadowbridge Arcade, Pennywhistle Arcade, Nimbus Plaza, Evergreen Circle, Umbra Theater, Silvercrest Observatory, Copper Clock Square, Velvet Corner, Northwind Tower, Duskwood Park, Knight’s Market, Brass Lantern Tavern, King’s Row, Mosaic Plaza, Westgate Station, Twilight Harbor, Yarrow Plaza and Lunar Pier. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater, Silvercrest Observatory, Northwind Tower, Westgate Station, Yarrow Plaza, Lunar Pier. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway, Ironbridge Crossing, Pennywhistle Arcade, Umbra Theater, Silvercrest Observatory, Velvet Corner, Knight’s Market, Brass Lantern Tavern, Mosaic Plaza, Twilight Harbor, Yarrow Plaza, Lunar Pier. \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater, Brass Lantern Tavern, Westgate Station, Yarrow Plaza. \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Ironbridge Crossing, Shadowbridge Arcade, Nimbus Plaza, Evergreen Circle, Velvet Corner, Northwind Tower, Duskwood Park, Knight’s Market, Westgate Station, Twilight Harbor, Lunar Pier. \nThe Ironbridge Crossing has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade, Nimbus Plaza, Evergreen Circle, Copper Clock Square, Duskwood Park, Mosaic Plaza, Westgate Station. \nThe Shadowbridge Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Nimbus Plaza, Evergreen Circle, Umbra Theater, Velvet Corner, Duskwood Park, Brass Lantern Tavern, Mosaic Plaza, Westgate Station. \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Nimbus Plaza, Velvet Corner, Northwind Tower, King’s Row, Westgate Station, Lunar Pier. \nThe Nimbus Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory, Copper Clock Square, Northwind Tower, Duskwood Park, Knight’s Market, Brass Lantern Tavern, Mosaic Plaza, Twilight Harbor, Yarrow Plaza, Lunar Pier. \nThe Evergreen Circle has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater, Copper Clock Square, Duskwood Park, Knight’s Market, Brass Lantern Tavern, Mosaic Plaza, Lunar Pier. \nThe Umbra Theater has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory, Northwind Tower, Brass Lantern Tavern, Twilight Harbor, Lunar Pier. \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with Velvet Corner, Knight’s Market, Lunar Pier. \nThe Copper Clock Square has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, Duskwood Park, Knight’s Market, King’s Row, Mosaic Plaza, Twilight Harbor. \nThe Velvet Corner has overlapping signal areas with Knight’s Market, Mosaic Plaza, Twilight Harbor, Lunar Pier. \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park, Brass Lantern Tavern, Twilight Harbor, Yarrow Plaza. \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Westgate Station, Yarrow Plaza, Lunar Pier. \nThe Knight’s Market has overlapping signal areas with Twilight Harbor, Yarrow Plaza, Lunar Pier. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Twilight Harbor, Yarrow Plaza. \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Westgate Station, Yarrow Plaza. \nThe Twilight Harbor has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 23 major locations in the city: Cobalt Market, Haven Docks, Brass Lantern Tavern, Temple Square, Echo Station, Twilight Harbor, Beacon Tower, Quarry Point, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Flare Alley, Granite Plaza, Skyline Gardens, Horizon Mall, Primrose Boulevard, Opal Theater, Mosaic Plaza, King’s Row, Lighthouse Point, Gilded Archway, Umbra Theater, Flint Forge Quarter, Jade Fountain and Duskwood Park. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Cobalt Market has overlapping signal areas with Quarry Point, Mosaic Plaza, King’s Row, Lighthouse Point. \nThe Haven Docks has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Temple Square, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Flare Alley, Skyline Gardens, Horizon Mall, Primrose Boulevard, Mosaic Plaza, King’s Row, Gilded Archway, Jade Fountain, Duskwood Park. \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with Twilight Harbor, Beacon Tower, Quarry Point, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Flare Alley, Primrose Boulevard, Gilded Archway. \nThe Temple Square has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater, King’s Row, Lighthouse Point, Umbra Theater, Flint Forge Quarter, Jade Fountain. \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with Twilight Harbor, Beacon Tower, Quarry Point, Flare Alley, Granite Plaza, Skyline Gardens, Horizon Mall, Mosaic Plaza, Lighthouse Point. \nThe Twilight Harbor has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower, Quarry Point, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Granite Plaza, Skyline Gardens, Horizon Mall, Opal Theater, Lighthouse Point, Gilded Archway, Jade Fountain. \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral, Granite Plaza, Skyline Gardens, Horizon Mall, King’s Row, Gilded Archway, Flint Forge Quarter, Jade Fountain. \nThe Quarry Point has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral, Primrose Boulevard, Mosaic Plaza, King’s Row, Lighthouse Point, Gilded Archway, Umbra Theater, Flint Forge Quarter, Jade Fountain. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens, Flint Forge Quarter. \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater, Jade Fountain. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens, Opal Theater, Mosaic Plaza, King’s Row, Lighthouse Point, Umbra Theater, Jade Fountain. \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Horizon Mall, Primrose Boulevard, Opal Theater, Gilded Archway, Umbra Theater. \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Primrose Boulevard, Opal Theater, Mosaic Plaza, Flint Forge Quarter, Duskwood Park. \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza, Gilded Archway, Flint Forge Quarter, Duskwood Park. \nThe Opal Theater has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza, King’s Row, Umbra Theater, Jade Fountain. \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater, Flint Forge Quarter. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Flint Forge Quarter, Jade Fountain. \nThe Lighthouse Point has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater, Jade Fountain. \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater, Jade Fountain. \nThe Umbra Theater has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park. \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park. \nThe Jade Fountain has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Evergreen Circle has overlapping signal areas with Flare Alley, Haven Docks, Shadowbridge Arcade, Twilight Harbor, Rosewood Hall, Jasper Marina, Dragon’s Gate, Duskwood Park, Westgate Station, Azure Gardens. \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, Shadowbridge Arcade, Twilight Harbor, Rosewood Hall, Jasper Marina, Riverstone Wharf, Maplewood Conservatory, Westgate Station. \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, Knight’s Market, Rosewood Hall, Cobalt Market, Dragon’s Gate, Amber Plaza, Opal Theater, Duskwood Park, Azure Gardens. \nThe Haven Docks has overlapping signal areas with Rosewood Hall, Amber Plaza, Westgate Station. \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with Knight’s Market, Rosewood Hall, Jasper Marina, Cobalt Market, Dragon’s Gate, Primrose Boulevard, Granite Plaza, Brass Lantern Tavern, Duskwood Park. \nThe Knight’s Market has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade, Twilight Harbor, Jasper Marina, Cobalt Market, Opal Theater, Riverstone Wharf, Maplewood Conservatory, Azure Gardens. \nThe Shadowbridge Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Rosewood Hall, Jasper Marina, Cobalt Market, Amber Plaza, Primrose Boulevard, Yarrow Plaza, Granite Plaza, Duskwood Park, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Twilight Harbor has overlapping signal areas with Dragon’s Gate, Opal Theater, Primrose Boulevard, Granite Plaza, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Rosewood Hall has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina, Dragon’s Gate, Amber Plaza, Opal Theater, Primrose Boulevard, Brass Lantern Tavern, Duskwood Park, Azure Gardens. \nThe Jasper Marina has overlapping signal areas with Cobalt Market, Opal Theater, Primrose Boulevard, Riverstone Wharf, Westgate Station, Azure Gardens. \nThe Cobalt Market has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park. \nThe Dragon’s Gate has overlapping signal areas with Amber Plaza, Yarrow Plaza, Brass Lantern Tavern, Duskwood Park, Riverstone Wharf, Maplewood Conservatory, Azure Gardens. \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater, Primrose Boulevard, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Opal Theater has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, Granite Plaza, Duskwood Park, Riverstone Wharf, Westgate Station, Azure Gardens. \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, Granite Plaza, Brass Lantern Tavern, Azure Gardens. \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Duskwood Park, Maplewood Conservatory, Azure Gardens. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park, Azure Gardens. \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Riverstone Wharf has overlapping signal areas with Westgate Station, Azure Gardens. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 23 major locations in the city: Moonlit Promenade, Maplewood Conservatory, Umbra Theater, Shadowbridge Arcade, Pennywhistle Arcade, Brass Lantern Tavern, Haven Docks, Beacon Tower, Knight’s Market, Flare Alley, Northwind Tower, Duskwood Park, Union Square Market, Zenith Arena, Westgate Station, Azure Gardens, Jade Fountain, Granite Plaza, Horizon Mall, Copper Clock Square, Evergreen Circle, Willowshade Pavilion and Quartz District. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Moonlit Promenade has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater, Haven Docks, Beacon Tower, Flare Alley, Northwind Tower, Duskwood Park, Union Square Market, Azure Gardens, Jade Fountain, Evergreen Circle. \nThe Maplewood Conservatory has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade, Haven Docks, Knight’s Market, Flare Alley, Duskwood Park, Azure Gardens, Copper Clock Square, Quartz District. \nThe Umbra Theater has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Knight’s Market, Flare Alley, Duskwood Park, Azure Gardens, Jade Fountain, Copper Clock Square, Willowshade Pavilion. \nThe Shadowbridge Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Flare Alley, Northwind Tower, Duskwood Park, Union Square Market, Westgate Station, Azure Gardens, Horizon Mall, Copper Clock Square, Willowshade Pavilion, Quartz District. \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Knight’s Market, Union Square Market, Azure Gardens, Granite Plaza, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with Haven Docks, Knight’s Market, Northwind Tower, Union Square Market, Westgate Station, Azure Gardens, Horizon Mall, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Haven Docks has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower, Northwind Tower, Zenith Arena, Westgate Station, Jade Fountain, Willowshade Pavilion, Quartz District. \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, Union Square Market, Westgate Station, Granite Plaza, Copper Clock Square, Willowshade Pavilion. \nThe Knight’s Market has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, Horizon Mall, Quartz District. \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Zenith Arena, Azure Gardens, Granite Plaza, Horizon Mall, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park, Azure Gardens, Jade Fountain, Horizon Mall, Copper Clock Square, Willowshade Pavilion. \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Azure Gardens, Jade Fountain, Granite Plaza, Evergreen Circle, Willowshade Pavilion. \nThe Union Square Market has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza, Copper Clock Square, Evergreen Circle, Quartz District. \nThe Zenith Arena has overlapping signal areas with Horizon Mall. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Azure Gardens, Jade Fountain, Granite Plaza, Evergreen Circle, Willowshade Pavilion, Quartz District. \nThe Azure Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Jade Fountain, Horizon Mall, Evergreen Circle. \nThe Jade Fountain has overlapping signal areas with Horizon Mall, Willowshade Pavilion, Quartz District. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Evergreen Circle. \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Copper Clock Square. \nThe Copper Clock Square has overlapping signal areas with Evergreen Circle, Quartz District. \nThe Willowshade Pavilion has overlapping signal areas with Quartz District. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 23 major locations in the city: Dragon’s Gate, Brass Lantern Tavern, Pennywhistle Arcade, Evergreen Circle, Horizon Mall, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Riverstone Wharf, Mosaic Plaza, Zenith Arena, Maplewood Conservatory, Lunar Pier, Copper Clock Square, Primrose Boulevard, Quartz District, Skyline Gardens, Jasper Marina, Azure Gardens, Westgate Station, Beacon Tower, Shadowbridge Arcade, King’s Row, Sapphire Arena and Gilded Archway. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Dragon’s Gate has overlapping signal areas with Horizon Mall, Riverstone Wharf, Maplewood Conservatory, Primrose Boulevard, Westgate Station, Shadowbridge Arcade. \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade, Riverstone Wharf, Mosaic Plaza, Maplewood Conservatory, Lunar Pier, Copper Clock Square, Primrose Boulevard, Azure Gardens, Westgate Station. \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Horizon Mall, Mosaic Plaza, Zenith Arena, Lunar Pier, Primrose Boulevard, Quartz District, Jasper Marina, Westgate Station, Shadowbridge Arcade, Sapphire Arena, Gilded Archway. \nThe Evergreen Circle has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral, Mosaic Plaza, Maplewood Conservatory, Lunar Pier, Primrose Boulevard, Quartz District, Azure Gardens, Westgate Station, Shadowbridge Arcade, Gilded Archway. \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Maplewood Conservatory, Copper Clock Square, Primrose Boulevard, Quartz District, Skyline Gardens, King’s Row, Gilded Archway. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Riverstone Wharf, Maplewood Conservatory, Lunar Pier, Copper Clock Square, Jasper Marina, Sapphire Arena. \nThe Riverstone Wharf has overlapping signal areas with Zenith Arena, Lunar Pier, Copper Clock Square, Jasper Marina, Westgate Station, Shadowbridge Arcade, King’s Row. \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Zenith Arena, Primrose Boulevard, Skyline Gardens, Jasper Marina, Azure Gardens, Shadowbridge Arcade, Gilded Archway. \nThe Zenith Arena has overlapping signal areas with Quartz District, Skyline Gardens, Azure Gardens, Westgate Station, Beacon Tower, King’s Row, Gilded Archway. \nThe Maplewood Conservatory has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier, Copper Clock Square, Skyline Gardens, Azure Gardens, Westgate Station. \nThe Lunar Pier has overlapping signal areas with Primrose Boulevard, Jasper Marina, Beacon Tower, Shadowbridge Arcade, King’s Row. \nThe Copper Clock Square has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina, Shadowbridge Arcade, Gilded Archway. \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens, Jasper Marina, Sapphire Arena. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina, Westgate Station. \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Azure Gardens, Shadowbridge Arcade, King’s Row, Sapphire Arena. \nThe Jasper Marina has overlapping signal areas with Azure Gardens, Gilded Archway. \nThe Azure Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower, Shadowbridge Arcade. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower, Sapphire Arena, Gilded Archway. \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade, King’s Row, Sapphire Arena. \nThe Shadowbridge Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena. \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 23 major locations in the city: Sapphire Arena, Amber Plaza, Nimbus Plaza, Maplewood Conservatory, Mosaic Plaza, Westgate Station, Haven Docks, Oakshade Library, Cobalt Market, Rosewood Hall, Velvet Corner, Zenith Arena, Quarry Point, Temple Square, Lighthouse Point, Dragon’s Gate, Knight’s Market, Umbra Theater, Silvercrest Observatory, Riverstone Wharf, Lunar Pier, Moonlit Promenade and Horizon Mall. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with Amber Plaza, Westgate Station, Haven Docks, Cobalt Market, Velvet Corner, Quarry Point, Lighthouse Point, Knight’s Market, Umbra Theater, Silvercrest Observatory, Riverstone Wharf, Lunar Pier. \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Nimbus Plaza, Maplewood Conservatory, Westgate Station, Haven Docks, Oakshade Library, Rosewood Hall, Silvercrest Observatory, Lunar Pier. \nThe Nimbus Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Maplewood Conservatory, Mosaic Plaza, Temple Square, Lighthouse Point, Dragon’s Gate, Knight’s Market, Lunar Pier, Horizon Mall. \nThe Maplewood Conservatory has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza, Westgate Station, Oakshade Library, Velvet Corner, Temple Square, Lighthouse Point, Riverstone Wharf, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Velvet Corner, Zenith Arena, Knight’s Market, Umbra Theater, Riverstone Wharf, Horizon Mall. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Cobalt Market, Rosewood Hall, Velvet Corner, Zenith Arena, Quarry Point, Lunar Pier, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Haven Docks has overlapping signal areas with Oakshade Library, Umbra Theater, Lunar Pier. \nThe Oakshade Library has overlapping signal areas with Cobalt Market, Velvet Corner, Quarry Point, Dragon’s Gate, Umbra Theater, Riverstone Wharf, Lunar Pier, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Cobalt Market has overlapping signal areas with Quarry Point, Dragon’s Gate, Umbra Theater, Silvercrest Observatory, Lunar Pier. \nThe Rosewood Hall has overlapping signal areas with Velvet Corner, Zenith Arena, Quarry Point, Lighthouse Point, Dragon’s Gate, Knight’s Market, Umbra Theater, Silvercrest Observatory, Riverstone Wharf, Lunar Pier, Horizon Mall. \nThe Velvet Corner has overlapping signal areas with Quarry Point, Knight’s Market, Horizon Mall. \nThe Zenith Arena has overlapping signal areas with Lighthouse Point, Dragon’s Gate, Umbra Theater, Lunar Pier, Moonlit Promenade, Horizon Mall. \nThe Quarry Point has overlapping signal areas with Lighthouse Point, Silvercrest Observatory, Lunar Pier. \nThe Temple Square has overlapping signal areas with Dragon’s Gate. \nThe Lighthouse Point has overlapping signal areas with Dragon’s Gate, Knight’s Market, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Dragon’s Gate has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater, Riverstone Wharf, Horizon Mall. \nThe Knight’s Market has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater, Lunar Pier, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Umbra Theater has overlapping signal areas with Riverstone Wharf, Moonlit Promenade, Horizon Mall. \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier, Horizon Mall. \nThe Riverstone Wharf has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier, Moonlit Promenade. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 23 major locations in the city: Velvet Corner, Northwind Tower, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Granite Plaza, Skyline Gardens, Pennywhistle Arcade, Evergreen Circle, Knight’s Market, Copper Clock Square, Quarry Point, Mosaic Plaza, Jade Fountain, Amber Plaza, Yarrow Plaza, Opal Theater, Gilded Archway, Twilight Harbor, Dragon’s Gate, Rosewood Hall, Lunar Pier, Brass Lantern Tavern, Union Square Market and Flint Forge Quarter. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Velvet Corner has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza, Skyline Gardens, Knight’s Market, Quarry Point, Mosaic Plaza, Opal Theater, Gilded Archway, Twilight Harbor, Dragon’s Gate, Lunar Pier. \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade, Evergreen Circle, Copper Clock Square, Quarry Point, Jade Fountain, Opal Theater, Gilded Archway, Lunar Pier. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza, Pennywhistle Arcade, Quarry Point, Jade Fountain, Amber Plaza, Union Square Market, Flint Forge Quarter. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens, Quarry Point, Jade Fountain, Yarrow Plaza, Rosewood Hall, Lunar Pier, Brass Lantern Tavern, Union Square Market, Flint Forge Quarter. \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade, Knight’s Market, Copper Clock Square, Yarrow Plaza, Opal Theater, Twilight Harbor, Lunar Pier, Union Square Market. \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Copper Clock Square, Jade Fountain, Gilded Archway, Twilight Harbor. \nThe Evergreen Circle has overlapping signal areas with Quarry Point, Mosaic Plaza, Jade Fountain, Amber Plaza, Yarrow Plaza, Opal Theater, Gilded Archway, Rosewood Hall, Lunar Pier, Brass Lantern Tavern, Union Square Market. \nThe Knight’s Market has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater, Twilight Harbor, Lunar Pier, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Copper Clock Square has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza, Amber Plaza, Yarrow Plaza, Lunar Pier, Flint Forge Quarter. \nThe Quarry Point has overlapping signal areas with Jade Fountain, Yarrow Plaza, Opal Theater, Brass Lantern Tavern, Union Square Market. \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater, Gilded Archway, Dragon’s Gate, Rosewood Hall, Lunar Pier, Union Square Market, Flint Forge Quarter. \nThe Jade Fountain has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway, Twilight Harbor. \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza, Gilded Archway, Twilight Harbor, Dragon’s Gate, Rosewood Hall, Union Square Market, Flint Forge Quarter. \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway, Dragon’s Gate. \nThe Opal Theater has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway, Rosewood Hall, Lunar Pier, Union Square Market, Flint Forge Quarter. \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Twilight Harbor, Flint Forge Quarter. \nThe Twilight Harbor has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier, Flint Forge Quarter. \nThe Dragon’s Gate has overlapping signal areas with Rosewood Hall, Brass Lantern Tavern, Flint Forge Quarter. \nThe Rosewood Hall has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Lunar Pier has overlapping signal areas with Flint Forge Quarter. \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with Flint Forge Quarter. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Ironbridge Crossing has overlapping signal areas with Temple Square, Skyline Gardens, Flare Alley, Velvet Corner, Moonlit Promenade, Knight’s Market, Zenith Arena, Duskwood Park, Horizon Mall. \nThe Temple Square has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral, Umbra Theater, Willowshade Pavilion, Flare Alley, Moonlit Promenade, Zenith Arena, Duskwood Park, Silvercrest Observatory. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater, Amber Plaza, Skyline Gardens, Pennywhistle Arcade, Moonlit Promenade, Duskwood Park, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Umbra Theater has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater, Skyline Gardens, Brass Lantern Tavern, Moonlit Promenade, Duskwood Park, Horizon Mall, Quarry Point, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Opal Theater has overlapping signal areas with Amber Plaza, Brass Lantern Tavern, Silvercrest Observatory, Horizon Mall. \nThe Willowshade Pavilion has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade, Velvet Corner, Northwind Tower, Riverstone Wharf, Moonlit Promenade, Zenith Arena, Duskwood Park, Silvercrest Observatory, Horizon Mall, Jasper Marina, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens, Zenith Arena, Horizon Mall, Quarry Point. \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Velvet Corner, Brass Lantern Tavern, Duskwood Park, Silvercrest Observatory, Jasper Marina, Quarry Point. \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, Riverstone Wharf, Moonlit Promenade, Horizon Mall, Quarry Point, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Velvet Corner, Brass Lantern Tavern, Knight’s Market, Horizon Mall. \nThe Velvet Corner has overlapping signal areas with Riverstone Wharf, Knight’s Market, Zenith Arena, Duskwood Park, Jasper Marina, Quarry Point, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, Riverstone Wharf, Moonlit Promenade, Knight’s Market, Duskwood Park, Silvercrest Observatory, Horizon Mall, Jasper Marina, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with Moonlit Promenade, Knight’s Market, Zenith Arena, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Riverstone Wharf has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory, Horizon Mall. \nThe Moonlit Promenade has overlapping signal areas with Knight’s Market, Zenith Arena, Silvercrest Observatory, Horizon Mall, Jasper Marina. \nThe Knight’s Market has overlapping signal areas with Zenith Arena, Duskwood Park, Horizon Mall, Quarry Point. \nThe Zenith Arena has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park, Silvercrest Observatory, Quarry Point. \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina. \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Copper Clock Square. \nThe Jasper Marina has overlapping signal areas with Quarry Point, Copper Clock Square. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference.

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 23 major locations in the city: Quarry Point, Maplewood Conservatory, Jasper Marina, Willowshade Pavilion, Nimbus Plaza, Riverstone Wharf, Velvet Corner, Horizon Mall, Beacon Tower, Echo Station, Moonlit Promenade, Mosaic Plaza, Zenith Arena, Shadowbridge Arcade, Lighthouse Point, Cobalt Market, Gilded Archway, Rosewood Hall, Knight’s Market, King’s Row, Granite Plaza, Yarrow Plaza and Duskwood Park. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Quarry Point has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina, Willowshade Pavilion, Riverstone Wharf, Velvet Corner, Echo Station, Moonlit Promenade, Zenith Arena, Shadowbridge Arcade, Lighthouse Point, Rosewood Hall, King’s Row, Granite Plaza. \nThe Maplewood Conservatory has overlapping signal areas with Horizon Mall, Echo Station, Mosaic Plaza, Zenith Arena, Shadowbridge Arcade. \nThe Jasper Marina has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Riverstone Wharf, Horizon Mall, Moonlit Promenade, Mosaic Plaza, Cobalt Market, Gilded Archway, Knight’s Market, King’s Row, Granite Plaza. \nThe Willowshade Pavilion has overlapping signal areas with Velvet Corner, Echo Station, Moonlit Promenade, Knight’s Market, King’s Row, Granite Plaza, Yarrow Plaza, Duskwood Park. \nThe Nimbus Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Horizon Mall, Cobalt Market, Knight’s Market, King’s Row. \nThe Riverstone Wharf has overlapping signal areas with Velvet Corner, Horizon Mall, Beacon Tower, Moonlit Promenade, Lighthouse Point, Cobalt Market, Rosewood Hall, King’s Row, Yarrow Plaza. \nThe Velvet Corner has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station, Mosaic Plaza, King’s Row, Granite Plaza, Yarrow Plaza, Duskwood Park. \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Moonlit Promenade, Shadowbridge Arcade, Lighthouse Point, Rosewood Hall, King’s Row, Yarrow Plaza, Duskwood Park. \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station, Zenith Arena, Shadowbridge Arcade, Lighthouse Point, Gilded Archway, Knight’s Market, Yarrow Plaza, Duskwood Park. \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with Moonlit Promenade, Mosaic Plaza, Shadowbridge Arcade, Lighthouse Point, Cobalt Market, Knight’s Market, King’s Row, Granite Plaza, Yarrow Plaza. \nThe Moonlit Promenade has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza, Cobalt Market, King’s Row, Yarrow Plaza, Duskwood Park. \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Zenith Arena, Gilded Archway, Duskwood Park. \nThe Zenith Arena has overlapping signal areas with Lighthouse Point, King’s Row. \nThe Shadowbridge Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza. \nThe Lighthouse Point has overlapping signal areas with Rosewood Hall, King’s Row, Yarrow Plaza, Duskwood Park. \nThe Cobalt Market has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway, Granite Plaza. \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Knight’s Market, Duskwood Park. \nThe Rosewood Hall has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Granite Plaza, Yarrow Plaza, Duskwood Park. \nThe Knight’s Market has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Yarrow Plaza. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park. \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 23 major locations in the city: Pennywhistle Arcade, Nimbus Plaza, Gilded Archway, Zenith Arena, Granite Plaza, Lunar Pier, Silvercrest Observatory, Copper Clock Square, Yarrow Plaza, Jade Fountain, Northwind Tower, Horizon Mall, Cobalt Market, Moonlit Promenade, Knight’s Market, Flint Forge Quarter, Lighthouse Point, Haven Docks, Amber Plaza, King’s Row, Temple Square, Azure Gardens and Primrose Boulevard. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Nimbus Plaza, Zenith Arena, Granite Plaza, Jade Fountain, Northwind Tower, Knight’s Market, Flint Forge Quarter, Lighthouse Point, Azure Gardens. \nThe Nimbus Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Copper Clock Square, Northwind Tower, Horizon Mall, Flint Forge Quarter, Lighthouse Point, Amber Plaza, King’s Row, Azure Gardens, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Zenith Arena, Lunar Pier, Silvercrest Observatory, Northwind Tower, Cobalt Market, Knight’s Market, Flint Forge Quarter, King’s Row, Temple Square. \nThe Zenith Arena has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza, Copper Clock Square, Yarrow Plaza, Moonlit Promenade, Flint Forge Quarter, Amber Plaza, Temple Square, Azure Gardens, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Horizon Mall, Flint Forge Quarter, Amber Plaza. \nThe Lunar Pier has overlapping signal areas with Copper Clock Square, Cobalt Market, Haven Docks, Azure Gardens. \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with Copper Clock Square, Northwind Tower, Horizon Mall, Cobalt Market, Moonlit Promenade, Temple Square, Azure Gardens, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Copper Clock Square has overlapping signal areas with Jade Fountain, Northwind Tower, Horizon Mall, Knight’s Market, Flint Forge Quarter, Amber Plaza, King’s Row, Temple Square, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Jade Fountain, Northwind Tower, Temple Square, Azure Gardens. \nThe Jade Fountain has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, Horizon Mall, Cobalt Market, Moonlit Promenade, Knight’s Market, King’s Row, Temple Square, Azure Gardens, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with Moonlit Promenade, Flint Forge Quarter, King’s Row, Temple Square. \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Cobalt Market, Flint Forge Quarter, Lighthouse Point, Haven Docks, Amber Plaza, King’s Row, Temple Square. \nThe Cobalt Market has overlapping signal areas with Knight’s Market, Lighthouse Point, Amber Plaza. \nThe Moonlit Promenade has overlapping signal areas with Amber Plaza, King’s Row, Temple Square, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Knight’s Market has overlapping signal areas with Lighthouse Point, Haven Docks. \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Haven Docks, Azure Gardens, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Lighthouse Point has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Temple Square, Azure Gardens. \nThe Haven Docks has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Temple Square, Azure Gardens. \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Azure Gardens. \nThe Azure Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Primrose Boulevard. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 23 major locations in the city: Lighthouse Point, Mosaic Plaza, Flare Alley, Brass Lantern Tavern, Quarry Point, Westgate Station, Zenith Arena, Haven Docks, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Twilight Harbor, Riverstone Wharf, Sapphire Arena, Skyline Gardens, Ironbridge Crossing, Nimbus Plaza, Primrose Boulevard, Velvet Corner, Beacon Tower, Quartz District, Granite Plaza, Shadowbridge Arcade, Azure Gardens and Willowshade Pavilion. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Lighthouse Point has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Westgate Station, Haven Docks, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Twilight Harbor, Sapphire Arena, Skyline Gardens, Ironbridge Crossing, Primrose Boulevard, Beacon Tower. \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Quarry Point, Haven Docks, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Sapphire Arena, Nimbus Plaza, Velvet Corner. \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Quarry Point, Westgate Station, Zenith Arena, Riverstone Wharf, Sapphire Arena, Ironbridge Crossing, Nimbus Plaza, Velvet Corner, Beacon Tower. \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with Zenith Arena, Twilight Harbor, Sapphire Arena, Ironbridge Crossing, Primrose Boulevard, Beacon Tower, Quartz District, Azure Gardens, Willowshade Pavilion. \nThe Quarry Point has overlapping signal areas with Westgate Station, Zenith Arena, Haven Docks, Riverstone Wharf, Ironbridge Crossing, Nimbus Plaza, Primrose Boulevard, Velvet Corner. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Haven Docks, Sapphire Arena, Beacon Tower, Quartz District, Granite Plaza, Azure Gardens. \nThe Zenith Arena has overlapping signal areas with Haven Docks, Sapphire Arena, Ironbridge Crossing, Nimbus Plaza, Primrose Boulevard, Beacon Tower, Granite Plaza, Shadowbridge Arcade. \nThe Haven Docks has overlapping signal areas with Riverstone Wharf, Sapphire Arena, Ironbridge Crossing, Beacon Tower, Azure Gardens, Willowshade Pavilion. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Twilight Harbor, Primrose Boulevard, Granite Plaza, Shadowbridge Arcade. \nThe Twilight Harbor has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena, Ironbridge Crossing, Velvet Corner, Beacon Tower, Granite Plaza, Shadowbridge Arcade. \nThe Riverstone Wharf has overlapping signal areas with Primrose Boulevard, Beacon Tower, Quartz District, Shadowbridge Arcade, Willowshade Pavilion. \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with Velvet Corner, Beacon Tower, Quartz District. \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Primrose Boulevard, Velvet Corner, Quartz District, Shadowbridge Arcade. \nThe Ironbridge Crossing has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower, Quartz District, Granite Plaza, Azure Gardens. \nThe Nimbus Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza, Shadowbridge Arcade, Willowshade Pavilion. \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower, Willowshade Pavilion. \nThe Velvet Corner has overlapping signal areas with Quartz District, Shadowbridge Arcade, Willowshade Pavilion. \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with Quartz District, Granite Plaza, Azure Gardens, Willowshade Pavilion. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza, Shadowbridge Arcade. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Azure Gardens, Willowshade Pavilion. \nThe Shadowbridge Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Azure Gardens. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 23 major locations in the city: Shadowbridge Arcade, Lighthouse Point, Brass Lantern Tavern, Union Square Market, Granite Plaza, Flare Alley, Riverstone Wharf, Dragon’s Gate, Twilight Harbor, Westgate Station, Silvercrest Observatory, Sapphire Arena, Horizon Mall, Oakshade Library, Rosewood Hall, Opal Theater, Echo Station, Willowshade Pavilion, Yarrow Plaza, Zenith Arena, Moonlit Promenade, Quarry Point and Skyline Gardens. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Shadowbridge Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Lighthouse Point, Brass Lantern Tavern, Dragon’s Gate, Westgate Station, Sapphire Arena, Horizon Mall, Rosewood Hall, Opal Theater, Yarrow Plaza, Moonlit Promenade, Skyline Gardens. \nThe Lighthouse Point has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza, Dragon’s Gate, Sapphire Arena, Oakshade Library, Rosewood Hall, Echo Station, Willowshade Pavilion, Yarrow Plaza, Zenith Arena. \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with Rosewood Hall, Zenith Arena, Moonlit Promenade, Quarry Point. \nThe Union Square Market has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza, Flare Alley, Twilight Harbor, Westgate Station, Rosewood Hall, Echo Station, Yarrow Plaza, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Riverstone Wharf, Westgate Station, Silvercrest Observatory, Sapphire Arena, Oakshade Library, Opal Theater, Echo Station, Zenith Arena, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Riverstone Wharf, Westgate Station, Silvercrest Observatory, Opal Theater, Yarrow Plaza, Quarry Point, Skyline Gardens. \nThe Riverstone Wharf has overlapping signal areas with Twilight Harbor, Westgate Station, Silvercrest Observatory, Sapphire Arena, Horizon Mall, Rosewood Hall, Opal Theater, Willowshade Pavilion, Yarrow Plaza, Quarry Point, Skyline Gardens. \nThe Dragon’s Gate has overlapping signal areas with Twilight Harbor, Silvercrest Observatory, Horizon Mall, Oakshade Library, Rosewood Hall, Echo Station, Yarrow Plaza, Zenith Arena, Moonlit Promenade, Skyline Gardens. \nThe Twilight Harbor has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory, Horizon Mall, Opal Theater, Yarrow Plaza, Moonlit Promenade, Skyline Gardens. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory, Opal Theater, Yarrow Plaza, Zenith Arena, Quarry Point. \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena, Echo Station, Yarrow Plaza. \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with Oakshade Library, Echo Station, Zenith Arena. \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Rosewood Hall, Opal Theater, Willowshade Pavilion, Quarry Point. \nThe Oakshade Library has overlapping signal areas with Rosewood Hall, Echo Station, Willowshade Pavilion, Yarrow Plaza, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Rosewood Hall has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater, Moonlit Promenade, Skyline Gardens. \nThe Opal Theater has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion. \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Willowshade Pavilion has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens. \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Zenith Arena, Moonlit Promenade, Quarry Point. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Velvet Corner has overlapping signal areas with Amber Plaza, King’s Row, Lighthouse Point, Umbra Theater, Lunar Pier, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Copper Clock Square, Skyline Gardens, Azure Gardens, Duskwood Park, Dragon’s Gate, Lighthouse Point, Umbra Theater, Brass Lantern Tavern, Jade Fountain. \nThe Haven Docks has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina, Northwind Tower, Temple Square, Dragon’s Gate, Lighthouse Point, Umbra Theater, Lunar Pier, Brass Lantern Tavern, Mosaic Plaza, Jade Fountain, Horizon Mall. \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Copper Clock Square, Primrose Boulevard, Skyline Gardens, King’s Row, Northwind Tower, Cobalt Market, Umbra Theater, Brass Lantern Tavern, Jade Fountain, Horizon Mall. \nThe Copper Clock Square has overlapping signal areas with Azure Gardens, Duskwood Park, Temple Square, Lunar Pier. \nThe Jasper Marina has overlapping signal areas with Primrose Boulevard, Azure Gardens, King’s Row, Duskwood Park, Temple Square, Cobalt Market, Umbra Theater, Jade Fountain, Horizon Mall. \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Northwind Tower, Dragon’s Gate, Brass Lantern Tavern, Horizon Mall. \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Azure Gardens, King’s Row, Temple Square, Cobalt Market, Dragon’s Gate, Lighthouse Point, Umbra Theater, Brass Lantern Tavern, Horizon Mall. \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park, Brass Lantern Tavern, Horizon Mall. \nThe Azure Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park, Umbra Theater, Brass Lantern Tavern, Jade Fountain. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, Duskwood Park, Temple Square, Umbra Theater, Lunar Pier, Brass Lantern Tavern, Jade Fountain. \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with Temple Square, Cobalt Market, Umbra Theater, Mosaic Plaza, Jade Fountain. \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Cobalt Market, Lighthouse Point, Jade Fountain. \nThe Temple Square has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier, Brass Lantern Tavern, Mosaic Plaza, Jade Fountain. \nThe Cobalt Market has overlapping signal areas with Dragon’s Gate, Lighthouse Point, Jade Fountain, Horizon Mall. \nThe Dragon’s Gate has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier, Mosaic Plaza, Jade Fountain, Horizon Mall. \nThe Lighthouse Point has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Umbra Theater has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza, Jade Fountain, Horizon Mall. \nThe Lunar Pier has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza, Horizon Mall. \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Horizon Mall. \nThe Jade Fountain has overlapping signal areas with Horizon Mall. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 23 major locations in the city: Maplewood Conservatory, Evergreen Circle, Flint Forge Quarter, Brass Lantern Tavern, Knight’s Market, Rosewood Hall, King’s Row, Mosaic Plaza, Umbra Theater, Westgate Station, Granite Plaza, Silvercrest Observatory, Lighthouse Point, Zenith Arena, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Cobalt Market, Echo Station, Flare Alley, Nimbus Plaza, Union Square Market, Moonlit Promenade, Opal Theater and Primrose Boulevard. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Maplewood Conservatory has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Mosaic Plaza, Umbra Theater, Granite Plaza, Flare Alley, Nimbus Plaza, Union Square Market, Moonlit Promenade, Opal Theater, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Evergreen Circle has overlapping signal areas with Flint Forge Quarter, Rosewood Hall, King’s Row, Umbra Theater, Granite Plaza, Zenith Arena, Cobalt Market, Nimbus Plaza, Moonlit Promenade, Opal Theater. \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Mosaic Plaza, Umbra Theater, Westgate Station, Granite Plaza, Silvercrest Observatory, Lighthouse Point, Zenith Arena, Flare Alley, Nimbus Plaza, Opal Theater. \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Mosaic Plaza, Umbra Theater, Zenith Arena, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Nimbus Plaza, Union Square Market, Opal Theater. \nThe Knight’s Market has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza, Westgate Station, Flare Alley, Nimbus Plaza, Opal Theater, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Rosewood Hall has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Cobalt Market, Flare Alley, Nimbus Plaza, Union Square Market. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater, Westgate Station, Granite Plaza, Silvercrest Observatory, Flare Alley, Nimbus Plaza, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater, Silvercrest Observatory, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Cobalt Market, Nimbus Plaza, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Umbra Theater has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station, Moonlit Promenade, Opal Theater. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory, Lighthouse Point, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Echo Station, Nimbus Plaza, Opal Theater, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station, Nimbus Plaza, Union Square Market, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral, Cobalt Market, Flare Alley, Union Square Market, Opal Theater. \nThe Lighthouse Point has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station, Union Square Market, Moonlit Promenade, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Zenith Arena has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral, Flare Alley, Opal Theater, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station, Nimbus Plaza, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Cobalt Market has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater. \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with Flare Alley, Nimbus Plaza, Moonlit Promenade, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater. \nThe Nimbus Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Union Square Market, Moonlit Promenade. \nThe Moonlit Promenade has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Opal Theater has overlapping signal areas with Primrose Boulevard. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 23 major locations in the city: King’s Row, Oakshade Library, Skyline Gardens, Granite Plaza, Pennywhistle Arcade, Northwind Tower, Dragon’s Gate, Echo Station, Temple Square, Silvercrest Observatory, Opal Theater, Zenith Arena, Haven Docks, Nimbus Plaza, Mosaic Plaza, Evergreen Circle, Brass Lantern Tavern, Union Square Market, Willowshade Pavilion, Azure Gardens, Knight’s Market, Copper Clock Square and Velvet Corner. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens, Pennywhistle Arcade, Northwind Tower, Echo Station, Mosaic Plaza, Evergreen Circle, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Oakshade Library has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade, Echo Station, Temple Square, Silvercrest Observatory, Zenith Arena, Nimbus Plaza, Union Square Market, Copper Clock Square, Velvet Corner. \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade, Northwind Tower, Echo Station, Opal Theater, Mosaic Plaza, Evergreen Circle, Brass Lantern Tavern, Union Square Market, Velvet Corner. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, Dragon’s Gate, Opal Theater, Zenith Arena, Haven Docks, Union Square Market, Willowshade Pavilion, Velvet Corner. \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Northwind Tower, Temple Square, Silvercrest Observatory, Opal Theater, Nimbus Plaza, Brass Lantern Tavern, Union Square Market, Copper Clock Square, Velvet Corner. \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with Dragon’s Gate, Temple Square, Mosaic Plaza, Evergreen Circle, Willowshade Pavilion, Velvet Corner. \nThe Dragon’s Gate has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater, Zenith Arena, Haven Docks, Nimbus Plaza, Evergreen Circle, Brass Lantern Tavern, Union Square Market, Willowshade Pavilion. \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with Temple Square, Silvercrest Observatory, Opal Theater, Mosaic Plaza, Evergreen Circle, Brass Lantern Tavern, Willowshade Pavilion, Azure Gardens, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Temple Square has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory, Opal Theater, Haven Docks, Nimbus Plaza, Mosaic Plaza, Evergreen Circle, Union Square Market, Willowshade Pavilion, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza, Willowshade Pavilion, Copper Clock Square, Velvet Corner. \nThe Opal Theater has overlapping signal areas with Haven Docks, Brass Lantern Tavern, Copper Clock Square, Velvet Corner. \nThe Zenith Arena has overlapping signal areas with Evergreen Circle, Brass Lantern Tavern, Azure Gardens. \nThe Haven Docks has overlapping signal areas with Nimbus Plaza, Willowshade Pavilion, Azure Gardens, Knight’s Market. \nThe Nimbus Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Evergreen Circle, Union Square Market, Azure Gardens, Knight’s Market, Copper Clock Square, Velvet Corner. \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Knight’s Market. \nThe Evergreen Circle has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Union Square Market, Knight’s Market, Velvet Corner. \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with Copper Clock Square. \nThe Union Square Market has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Azure Gardens. \nThe Willowshade Pavilion has overlapping signal areas with Azure Gardens. \nThe Azure Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Velvet Corner. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 23 major locations in the city: Copper Clock Square, King’s Row, Quarry Point, Pennywhistle Arcade, Echo Station, Riverstone Wharf, Knight’s Market, Mosaic Plaza, Westgate Station, Jasper Marina, Maplewood Conservatory, Zenith Arena, Yarrow Plaza, Azure Gardens, Beacon Tower, Evergreen Circle, Duskwood Park, Shadowbridge Arcade, Opal Theater, Union Square Market, Temple Square, Horizon Mall and Velvet Corner. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Copper Clock Square has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Quarry Point, Knight’s Market, Westgate Station, Azure Gardens, Evergreen Circle, Shadowbridge Arcade, Union Square Market, Velvet Corner. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station, Riverstone Wharf, Mosaic Plaza, Westgate Station, Zenith Arena, Yarrow Plaza, Opal Theater, Union Square Market, Temple Square, Velvet Corner. \nThe Quarry Point has overlapping signal areas with Riverstone Wharf, Zenith Arena, Yarrow Plaza, Evergreen Circle, Union Square Market, Temple Square, Horizon Mall, Velvet Corner. \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza, Westgate Station, Zenith Arena, Azure Gardens, Beacon Tower, Evergreen Circle, Duskwood Park, Shadowbridge Arcade, Union Square Market, Temple Square, Horizon Mall. \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with Evergreen Circle, Duskwood Park, Union Square Market, Temple Square, Velvet Corner. \nThe Riverstone Wharf has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza, Westgate Station, Maplewood Conservatory, Zenith Arena, Azure Gardens, Evergreen Circle, Duskwood Park, Shadowbridge Arcade, Union Square Market. \nThe Knight’s Market has overlapping signal areas with Westgate Station, Maplewood Conservatory, Yarrow Plaza, Azure Gardens, Duskwood Park, Velvet Corner. \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina, Yarrow Plaza, Azure Gardens, Beacon Tower, Duskwood Park, Union Square Market. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Zenith Arena, Yarrow Plaza, Beacon Tower, Duskwood Park, Union Square Market, Temple Square, Horizon Mall, Velvet Corner. \nThe Jasper Marina has overlapping signal areas with Azure Gardens, Duskwood Park. \nThe Maplewood Conservatory has overlapping signal areas with Azure Gardens, Duskwood Park, Opal Theater. \nThe Zenith Arena has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park, Opal Theater, Temple Square. \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Azure Gardens, Union Square Market, Temple Square. \nThe Azure Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower, Evergreen Circle, Duskwood Park, Shadowbridge Arcade, Union Square Market, Horizon Mall. \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with Evergreen Circle, Duskwood Park, Union Square Market, Horizon Mall. \nThe Evergreen Circle has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park, Temple Square, Velvet Corner. \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade, Horizon Mall. \nThe Shadowbridge Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Union Square Market, Temple Square, Velvet Corner. \nThe Opal Theater has overlapping signal areas with Temple Square, Horizon Mall, Velvet Corner. \nThe Temple Square has overlapping signal areas with Horizon Mall. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 23 major locations in the city: Willowshade Pavilion, Opal Theater, Oakshade Library, Union Square Market, Echo Station, Brass Lantern Tavern, Velvet Corner, Pennywhistle Arcade, Riverstone Wharf, Flint Forge Quarter, Beacon Tower, Flare Alley, Horizon Mall, Sapphire Arena, Gilded Archway, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Umbra Theater, Ironbridge Crossing, Duskwood Park, Maplewood Conservatory, Silvercrest Observatory, Zenith Arena and Shadowbridge Arcade. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Willowshade Pavilion has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater, Oakshade Library, Brass Lantern Tavern, Riverstone Wharf, Flint Forge Quarter, Flare Alley, Sapphire Arena, Ironbridge Crossing, Zenith Arena. \nThe Opal Theater has overlapping signal areas with Union Square Market, Echo Station, Brass Lantern Tavern, Velvet Corner, Horizon Mall, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Maplewood Conservatory, Zenith Arena. \nThe Oakshade Library has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station, Velvet Corner, Riverstone Wharf, Beacon Tower, Sapphire Arena, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Silvercrest Observatory, Zenith Arena, Shadowbridge Arcade. \nThe Union Square Market has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station, Velvet Corner, Beacon Tower, Horizon Mall, Sapphire Arena, Gilded Archway, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Ironbridge Crossing. \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Pennywhistle Arcade, Beacon Tower, Horizon Mall, Ironbridge Crossing, Duskwood Park, Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade, Horizon Mall, Gilded Archway, Umbra Theater, Duskwood Park, Silvercrest Observatory, Shadowbridge Arcade. \nThe Velvet Corner has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade, Flare Alley, Umbra Theater, Duskwood Park, Zenith Arena, Shadowbridge Arcade. \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Riverstone Wharf, Horizon Mall, Sapphire Arena, Gilded Archway, Ironbridge Crossing, Duskwood Park, Silvercrest Observatory, Shadowbridge Arcade. \nThe Riverstone Wharf has overlapping signal areas with Flint Forge Quarter, Gilded Archway, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Umbra Theater, Duskwood Park. \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena, Umbra Theater, Maplewood Conservatory, Silvercrest Observatory, Zenith Arena, Shadowbridge Arcade. \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with Flare Alley, Gilded Archway, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Umbra Theater, Duskwood Park, Zenith Arena. \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral, Zenith Arena. \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena, Ironbridge Crossing, Maplewood Conservatory, Silvercrest Observatory, Zenith Arena. \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral, Ironbridge Crossing, Maplewood Conservatory. \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory, Zenith Arena. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Maplewood Conservatory, Silvercrest Observatory. \nThe Umbra Theater has overlapping signal areas with Ironbridge Crossing, Silvercrest Observatory, Zenith Arena, Shadowbridge Arcade. \nThe Ironbridge Crossing has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park, Maplewood Conservatory, Silvercrest Observatory, Zenith Arena, Shadowbridge Arcade. \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Zenith Arena. \nThe Maplewood Conservatory has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade. \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral, Rosewood Hall, Oakshade Library, Silvercrest Observatory, Cobalt Market, Zenith Arena, Shadowbridge Arcade, Knight’s Market. \nThe Flint Forge Quarter has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral, Oakshade Library, Copper Clock Square, Silvercrest Observatory, Westgate Station, Velvet Corner, Jade Fountain, Shadowbridge Arcade, Knight’s Market, Evergreen Circle. \nThe Opal Theater has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral, Zenith Arena, Westgate Station, Willowshade Pavilion, Duskwood Park, Velvet Corner, Jade Fountain, Shadowbridge Arcade, Knight’s Market, Jasper Marina, Riverstone Wharf, Evergreen Circle. \nThe Maplewood Conservatory has overlapping signal areas with Copper Clock Square, Cobalt Market, Westgate Station, Velvet Corner, Jasper Marina, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Oakshade Library, Copper Clock Square, Silvercrest Observatory, Zenith Arena, Westgate Station, Velvet Corner, Knight’s Market, Riverstone Wharf, Evergreen Circle. \nThe Rosewood Hall has overlapping signal areas with Oakshade Library, Copper Clock Square, Zenith Arena, Westgate Station, Willowshade Pavilion, Granite Plaza. \nThe Quarry Point has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory, Cobalt Market, Zenith Arena, Duskwood Park, Velvet Corner, Granite Plaza, Knight’s Market, Jasper Marina, Riverstone Wharf, Evergreen Circle. \nThe Oakshade Library has overlapping signal areas with Cobalt Market, Westgate Station, Willowshade Pavilion, Jade Fountain, Shadowbridge Arcade, Knight’s Market, Jasper Marina. \nThe Copper Clock Square has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory, Granite Plaza, Shadowbridge Arcade, Jasper Marina, Evergreen Circle. \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with Zenith Arena, Willowshade Pavilion, Shadowbridge Arcade. \nThe Cobalt Market has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park, Velvet Corner, Shadowbridge Arcade, Knight’s Market, Jasper Marina. \nThe Zenith Arena has overlapping signal areas with Westgate Station, Granite Plaza, Jade Fountain. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Duskwood Park, Velvet Corner, Granite Plaza, Jade Fountain, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Willowshade Pavilion has overlapping signal areas with Duskwood Park, Granite Plaza, Shadowbridge Arcade, Knight’s Market, Jasper Marina. \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Velvet Corner, Granite Plaza. \nThe Velvet Corner has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade, Knight’s Market. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Evergreen Circle. \nThe Jade Fountain has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade, Knight’s Market, Jasper Marina. \nThe Shadowbridge Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina. \nThe Riverstone Wharf has overlapping signal areas with Evergreen Circle. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference.

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 23 major locations in the city: Yarrow Plaza, Maplewood Conservatory, Willowshade Pavilion, Zenith Arena, Nimbus Plaza, Mosaic Plaza, Lunar Pier, Amber Plaza, Riverstone Wharf, Gilded Archway, Moonlit Promenade, Jasper Marina, Knight’s Market, Jade Fountain, Pennywhistle Arcade, Dragon’s Gate, Brass Lantern Tavern, Silvercrest Observatory, Twilight Harbor, Cobalt Market, Quartz District, Ivory Spire Cathedral and Beacon Tower. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Maplewood Conservatory, Nimbus Plaza, Amber Plaza, Gilded Archway, Moonlit Promenade, Knight’s Market, Dragon’s Gate, Brass Lantern Tavern, Beacon Tower. \nThe Maplewood Conservatory has overlapping signal areas with Amber Plaza, Gilded Archway, Moonlit Promenade, Knight’s Market, Jade Fountain, Pennywhistle Arcade, Silvercrest Observatory, Twilight Harbor, Cobalt Market, Beacon Tower. \nThe Willowshade Pavilion has overlapping signal areas with Nimbus Plaza, Mosaic Plaza, Amber Plaza, Gilded Archway, Moonlit Promenade, Knight’s Market, Pennywhistle Arcade, Brass Lantern Tavern, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Zenith Arena has overlapping signal areas with Nimbus Plaza, Amber Plaza, Riverstone Wharf, Moonlit Promenade, Dragon’s Gate, Silvercrest Observatory, Twilight Harbor, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Nimbus Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier, Amber Plaza, Moonlit Promenade, Jade Fountain, Dragon’s Gate, Silvercrest Observatory. \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina, Jade Fountain, Pennywhistle Arcade, Dragon’s Gate, Brass Lantern Tavern, Silvercrest Observatory, Cobalt Market, Beacon Tower. \nThe Lunar Pier has overlapping signal areas with Amber Plaza, Gilded Archway, Brass Lantern Tavern, Silvercrest Observatory, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Beacon Tower. \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Moonlit Promenade, Jasper Marina, Dragon’s Gate, Brass Lantern Tavern, Silvercrest Observatory. \nThe Riverstone Wharf has overlapping signal areas with Moonlit Promenade, Jade Fountain, Pennywhistle Arcade, Twilight Harbor, Cobalt Market. \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Moonlit Promenade, Jasper Marina, Dragon’s Gate, Brass Lantern Tavern, Twilight Harbor, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Moonlit Promenade has overlapping signal areas with Jade Fountain, Pennywhistle Arcade, Twilight Harbor, Beacon Tower. \nThe Jasper Marina has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade, Brass Lantern Tavern, Twilight Harbor, Cobalt Market, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Beacon Tower. \nThe Knight’s Market has overlapping signal areas with Jade Fountain, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Jade Fountain has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade, Brass Lantern Tavern, Cobalt Market. \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Dragon’s Gate, Brass Lantern Tavern, Silvercrest Observatory, Quartz District, Beacon Tower. \nThe Dragon’s Gate has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Silvercrest Observatory, Cobalt Market, Beacon Tower. \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with Twilight Harbor, Cobalt Market, Beacon Tower. \nThe Twilight Harbor has overlapping signal areas with Cobalt Market, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Beacon Tower. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral, Beacon Tower. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 23 major locations in the city: Granite Plaza, Duskwood Park, Pennywhistle Arcade, Temple Square, Umbra Theater, Union Square Market, Riverstone Wharf, King’s Row, Flare Alley, Haven Docks, Copper Clock Square, Horizon Mall, Velvet Corner, Twilight Harbor, Dragon’s Gate, Opal Theater, Lighthouse Point, Knight’s Market, Maplewood Conservatory, Echo Station, Quarry Point, Skyline Gardens and Azure Gardens. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Temple Square, Union Square Market, Riverstone Wharf, Horizon Mall, Velvet Corner, Echo Station, Azure Gardens. \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade, Union Square Market, Riverstone Wharf, King’s Row, Flare Alley, Haven Docks, Twilight Harbor, Opal Theater, Echo Station. \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Riverstone Wharf, King’s Row, Flare Alley, Copper Clock Square, Horizon Mall, Velvet Corner, Echo Station, Quarry Point, Skyline Gardens, Azure Gardens. \nThe Temple Square has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater, Flare Alley, Haven Docks, Copper Clock Square, Dragon’s Gate, Opal Theater, Knight’s Market, Maplewood Conservatory, Quarry Point, Skyline Gardens, Azure Gardens. \nThe Umbra Theater has overlapping signal areas with Riverstone Wharf, King’s Row, Copper Clock Square, Horizon Mall, Dragon’s Gate, Opal Theater, Quarry Point. \nThe Union Square Market has overlapping signal areas with Riverstone Wharf, Horizon Mall, Velvet Corner, Twilight Harbor, Knight’s Market, Maplewood Conservatory, Azure Gardens. \nThe Riverstone Wharf has overlapping signal areas with Haven Docks, Horizon Mall, Twilight Harbor, Opal Theater. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Horizon Mall, Twilight Harbor, Maplewood Conservatory, Echo Station. \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Copper Clock Square, Velvet Corner, Twilight Harbor, Lighthouse Point, Knight’s Market, Azure Gardens. \nThe Haven Docks has overlapping signal areas with Copper Clock Square, Velvet Corner, Knight’s Market. \nThe Copper Clock Square has overlapping signal areas with Horizon Mall, Opal Theater, Lighthouse Point, Knight’s Market, Echo Station, Quarry Point, Azure Gardens. \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Twilight Harbor, Lighthouse Point, Knight’s Market, Echo Station, Azure Gardens. \nThe Velvet Corner has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater, Lighthouse Point, Maplewood Conservatory, Azure Gardens. \nThe Twilight Harbor has overlapping signal areas with Dragon’s Gate, Lighthouse Point, Knight’s Market, Maplewood Conservatory, Quarry Point, Azure Gardens. \nThe Dragon’s Gate has overlapping signal areas with Lighthouse Point, Skyline Gardens. \nThe Opal Theater has overlapping signal areas with Lighthouse Point, Knight’s Market, Maplewood Conservatory, Echo Station. \nThe Lighthouse Point has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station, Quarry Point, Skyline Gardens. \nThe Knight’s Market has overlapping signal areas with Maplewood Conservatory, Quarry Point. \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with Quarry Point, Skyline Gardens. \nThe Quarry Point has overlapping signal areas with Azure Gardens. \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Azure Gardens. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 23 major locations in the city: Jade Fountain, Union Square Market, Quarry Point, Flare Alley, Evergreen Circle, Ironbridge Crossing, Skyline Gardens, Umbra Theater, Pennywhistle Arcade, Brass Lantern Tavern, Velvet Corner, Quartz District, Gilded Archway, Twilight Harbor, Lighthouse Point, Mosaic Plaza, Horizon Mall, Sapphire Arena, Jasper Marina, Silvercrest Observatory, Westgate Station, Copper Clock Square and Amber Plaza. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Jade Fountain has overlapping signal areas with Ironbridge Crossing, Brass Lantern Tavern, Twilight Harbor, Lighthouse Point, Mosaic Plaza, Horizon Mall, Sapphire Arena, Silvercrest Observatory, Westgate Station, Amber Plaza. \nThe Union Square Market has overlapping signal areas with Quarry Point, Skyline Gardens, Gilded Archway, Jasper Marina, Silvercrest Observatory, Westgate Station, Amber Plaza. \nThe Quarry Point has overlapping signal areas with Flare Alley, Skyline Gardens, Umbra Theater, Pennywhistle Arcade, Velvet Corner, Quartz District, Sapphire Arena, Jasper Marina. \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Ironbridge Crossing, Umbra Theater, Velvet Corner, Mosaic Plaza, Silvercrest Observatory, Westgate Station. \nThe Evergreen Circle has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater, Velvet Corner, Quartz District, Horizon Mall, Westgate Station. \nThe Ironbridge Crossing has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens, Pennywhistle Arcade, Gilded Archway, Mosaic Plaza, Sapphire Arena, Jasper Marina, Westgate Station, Amber Plaza. \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Twilight Harbor, Lighthouse Point, Mosaic Plaza, Horizon Mall, Silvercrest Observatory, Westgate Station, Copper Clock Square, Amber Plaza. \nThe Umbra Theater has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade, Brass Lantern Tavern, Velvet Corner, Gilded Archway, Mosaic Plaza, Horizon Mall, Jasper Marina, Silvercrest Observatory, Westgate Station, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Velvet Corner, Gilded Archway, Mosaic Plaza, Sapphire Arena, Silvercrest Observatory, Westgate Station, Copper Clock Square, Amber Plaza. \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with Velvet Corner, Quartz District, Gilded Archway, Mosaic Plaza, Amber Plaza. \nThe Velvet Corner has overlapping signal areas with Lighthouse Point, Horizon Mall, Jasper Marina, Silvercrest Observatory, Amber Plaza. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway, Lighthouse Point, Jasper Marina, Silvercrest Observatory, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza, Jasper Marina, Westgate Station. \nThe Twilight Harbor has overlapping signal areas with Lighthouse Point, Mosaic Plaza, Horizon Mall, Silvercrest Observatory, Westgate Station, Amber Plaza. \nThe Lighthouse Point has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory, Westgate Station, Amber Plaza. \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina, Amber Plaza. \nThe Jasper Marina has overlapping signal areas with Westgate Station, Amber Plaza. \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with Westgate Station, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Copper Clock Square. \nThe Copper Clock Square has overlapping signal areas with Amber Plaza. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 23 major locations in the city: Maplewood Conservatory, Primrose Boulevard, Duskwood Park, Northwind Tower, Rosewood Hall, Pennywhistle Arcade, Silvercrest Observatory, Oakshade Library, Lunar Pier, Mosaic Plaza, King’s Row, Copper Clock Square, Haven Docks, Quarry Point, Opal Theater, Gilded Archway, Umbra Theater, Jasper Marina, Flare Alley, Echo Station, Jade Fountain, Brass Lantern Tavern and Riverstone Wharf. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Maplewood Conservatory has overlapping signal areas with Primrose Boulevard, Pennywhistle Arcade, Silvercrest Observatory, Oakshade Library, Lunar Pier, King’s Row, Quarry Point, Opal Theater, Gilded Archway, Umbra Theater, Jasper Marina, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with Oakshade Library, King’s Row, Copper Clock Square, Haven Docks, Quarry Point, Gilded Archway, Umbra Theater, Brass Lantern Tavern, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Duskwood Park has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory, Mosaic Plaza, Jasper Marina, Jade Fountain, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade, Silvercrest Observatory, Oakshade Library, King’s Row, Copper Clock Square, Quarry Point, Opal Theater, Umbra Theater, Jasper Marina, Brass Lantern Tavern, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Rosewood Hall has overlapping signal areas with Oakshade Library, Lunar Pier, King’s Row, Copper Clock Square, Haven Docks, Umbra Theater, Jasper Marina, Echo Station, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory, Oakshade Library, Lunar Pier, Mosaic Plaza, Copper Clock Square, Gilded Archway, Umbra Theater, Jasper Marina, Flare Alley. \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Copper Clock Square, Haven Docks, Quarry Point, Umbra Theater, Flare Alley, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Oakshade Library has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier, Mosaic Plaza, Haven Docks, Umbra Theater, Jasper Marina. \nThe Lunar Pier has overlapping signal areas with Copper Clock Square, Quarry Point, Umbra Theater, Jade Fountain, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Quarry Point, Gilded Archway, Jasper Marina, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater. \nThe Copper Clock Square has overlapping signal areas with Quarry Point, Flare Alley, Echo Station, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Haven Docks has overlapping signal areas with Quarry Point, Opal Theater, Umbra Theater, Jasper Marina, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Quarry Point has overlapping signal areas with Opal Theater, Umbra Theater, Jasper Marina, Echo Station, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Opal Theater has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway, Umbra Theater, Echo Station, Jade Fountain. \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station, Jade Fountain, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Umbra Theater has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Jasper Marina has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station. \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Riverstone Wharf. \nThe Jade Fountain has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with Riverstone Wharf. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Maplewood Conservatory, Zenith Arena, Gilded Archway, Knight’s Market, Rosewood Hall, Temple Square, Union Square Market. \nThe Jade Fountain has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Oakshade Library, Brass Lantern Tavern, Silvercrest Observatory, Gilded Archway, Rosewood Hall, Pennywhistle Arcade, Horizon Mall. \nThe Willowshade Pavilion has overlapping signal areas with Nimbus Plaza, Maplewood Conservatory, Mosaic Plaza, Brass Lantern Tavern, Jasper Marina, Zenith Arena, Gilded Archway, Riverstone Wharf, Beacon Tower, Horizon Mall, Echo Station. \nThe Oakshade Library has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory, Jasper Marina, Zenith Arena, Knight’s Market, Temple Square, Horizon Mall. \nThe Nimbus Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Zenith Arena, Gilded Archway, Knight’s Market, Rosewood Hall, Pennywhistle Arcade, Beacon Tower, Echo Station. \nThe Maplewood Conservatory has overlapping signal areas with Brass Lantern Tavern, Zenith Arena, Gilded Archway, Rosewood Hall, Temple Square, Beacon Tower, Horizon Mall, Velvet Corner. \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory, Gilded Archway, Temple Square, Union Square Market, Velvet Corner, Echo Station. \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory, Zenith Arena, Knight’s Market, Rosewood Hall, Temple Square, Horizon Mall, Velvet Corner, Lighthouse Point. \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina, Pennywhistle Arcade, Temple Square, Beacon Tower, Velvet Corner, Echo Station. \nThe Jasper Marina has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway, Knight’s Market, Rosewood Hall, Beacon Tower, Horizon Mall. \nThe Zenith Arena has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade, Horizon Mall, Union Square Market, Lighthouse Point. \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Rosewood Hall, Pennywhistle Arcade, Temple Square. \nThe Knight’s Market has overlapping signal areas with Riverstone Wharf, Temple Square, Beacon Tower, Velvet Corner, Echo Station. \nThe Riverstone Wharf has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower, Velvet Corner, Lighthouse Point. \nThe Rosewood Hall has overlapping signal areas with Pennywhistle Arcade, Temple Square, Beacon Tower, Velvet Corner, Echo Station. \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower, Velvet Corner, Echo Station, Lighthouse Point. \nThe Temple Square has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower, Union Square Market, Velvet Corner, Lighthouse Point. \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with Union Square Market. \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Union Square Market, Velvet Corner, Echo Station. \nThe Union Square Market has overlapping signal areas with Lighthouse Point. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference.

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 23 major locations in the city: Gilded Archway, Pennywhistle Arcade, Flare Alley, Union Square Market, Azure Gardens, Echo Station, Knight’s Market, Cobalt Market, Dragon’s Gate, Skyline Gardens, Mosaic Plaza, Lunar Pier, Nimbus Plaza, Sapphire Arena, Quartz District, Northwind Tower, Ivory Spire Cathedral, King’s Row, Umbra Theater, Westgate Station, Silvercrest Observatory, Jasper Marina and Primrose Boulevard. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Flare Alley, Echo Station, Cobalt Market, Dragon’s Gate, Skyline Gardens, Mosaic Plaza, Lunar Pier, Nimbus Plaza, Sapphire Arena, Northwind Tower, King’s Row, Umbra Theater. \nThe Pennywhistle Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Flare Alley, Union Square Market, Dragon’s Gate, Skyline Gardens, Sapphire Arena, Quartz District, Northwind Tower, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Umbra Theater, Jasper Marina. \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Union Square Market, Dragon’s Gate, Lunar Pier, Ivory Spire Cathedral, King’s Row. \nThe Union Square Market has overlapping signal areas with Azure Gardens, Echo Station, Knight’s Market, Dragon’s Gate, Skyline Gardens, Lunar Pier, Northwind Tower, King’s Row, Umbra Theater. \nThe Azure Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Echo Station, Cobalt Market, Dragon’s Gate, Skyline Gardens, Mosaic Plaza, Sapphire Arena, Northwind Tower, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Westgate Station, Jasper Marina. \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with Knight’s Market, Dragon’s Gate, Sapphire Arena, Quartz District, Northwind Tower, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Umbra Theater, Westgate Station, Silvercrest Observatory, Jasper Marina, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Knight’s Market has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens, Sapphire Arena, Quartz District, Umbra Theater, Westgate Station, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Cobalt Market has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens, Mosaic Plaza, Sapphire Arena, Quartz District, Northwind Tower, King’s Row, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Dragon’s Gate has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza, Lunar Pier, King’s Row, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza, Nimbus Plaza, Quartz District, Northwind Tower, Umbra Theater, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena, Northwind Tower, Jasper Marina, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Lunar Pier has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Westgate Station, Silvercrest Observatory. \nThe Nimbus Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Sapphire Arena, Quartz District, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Sapphire Arena has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Silvercrest Observatory, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Westgate Station. \nThe Northwind Tower has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Ivory Spire Cathedral has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Westgate Station, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Umbra Theater has overlapping signal areas with Westgate Station, Silvercrest Observatory, Jasper Marina. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina, Primrose Boulevard. \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 23 major locations in the city: Velvet Corner, Haven Docks, Lunar Pier, Brass Lantern Tavern, Quartz District, Copper Clock Square, Flare Alley, Ironbridge Crossing, Skyline Gardens, Quarry Point, Nimbus Plaza, Mosaic Plaza, Granite Plaza, Willowshade Pavilion, Shadowbridge Arcade, Westgate Station, Gilded Archway, Union Square Market, Jade Fountain, Sapphire Arena, Rosewood Hall, Northwind Tower and Jasper Marina. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Velvet Corner has overlapping signal areas with Lunar Pier, Brass Lantern Tavern, Quarry Point, Union Square Market, Jasper Marina. \nThe Haven Docks has overlapping signal areas with Quartz District, Copper Clock Square, Flare Alley, Ironbridge Crossing, Skyline Gardens, Quarry Point, Nimbus Plaza, Mosaic Plaza, Granite Plaza, Shadowbridge Arcade, Westgate Station, Gilded Archway, Union Square Market, Rosewood Hall, Northwind Tower, Jasper Marina. \nThe Lunar Pier has overlapping signal areas with Copper Clock Square, Skyline Gardens, Union Square Market, Jade Fountain, Northwind Tower, Jasper Marina. \nThe Brass Lantern Tavern has overlapping signal areas with Flare Alley, Ironbridge Crossing, Quarry Point, Nimbus Plaza, Mosaic Plaza, Granite Plaza, Willowshade Pavilion, Gilded Archway, Union Square Market, Jade Fountain, Northwind Tower. \nThe Quartz District has overlapping signal areas with Westgate Station, Jade Fountain, Rosewood Hall. \nThe Copper Clock Square has overlapping signal areas with Skyline Gardens, Nimbus Plaza, Mosaic Plaza, Granite Plaza, Willowshade Pavilion, Shadowbridge Arcade, Gilded Archway, Jade Fountain. \nThe Flare Alley has overlapping signal areas with Quarry Point, Nimbus Plaza, Mosaic Plaza, Granite Plaza, Willowshade Pavilion, Shadowbridge Arcade, Westgate Station, Sapphire Arena. \nThe Ironbridge Crossing has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza, Granite Plaza, Shadowbridge Arcade, Gilded Archway, Jade Fountain, Sapphire Arena. \nThe Skyline Gardens has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway, Jasper Marina. \nThe Quarry Point has overlapping signal areas with Nimbus Plaza, Mosaic Plaza, Granite Plaza, Westgate Station, Union Square Market, Sapphire Arena, Northwind Tower. \nThe Nimbus Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Granite Plaza, Willowshade Pavilion, Westgate Station, Gilded Archway, Jade Fountain, Sapphire Arena, Jasper Marina. \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade, Westgate Station, Jade Fountain, Sapphire Arena, Rosewood Hall, Jasper Marina. \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade, Westgate Station, Northwind Tower, Jasper Marina. \nThe Willowshade Pavilion has overlapping signal areas with Jade Fountain, Rosewood Hall, Northwind Tower. \nThe Shadowbridge Arcade has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway, Jade Fountain, Sapphire Arena, Rosewood Hall, Jasper Marina. \nThe Westgate Station has overlapping signal areas with Gilded Archway, Sapphire Arena, Northwind Tower. \nThe Gilded Archway has overlapping signal areas with Jade Fountain. \nThe Union Square Market has overlapping signal areas with Jade Fountain, Rosewood Hall, Northwind Tower. \nThe Rosewood Hall has overlapping signal areas with Jasper Marina. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",

  "Q": "I am designing a public Wi-Fi network for my city, with the goal of providing free high-speed internet access across various public areas. The network will cover 23 major locations in the city: Granite Plaza, Silvercrest Observatory, Rosewood Hall, Amber Plaza, Primrose Boulevard, Horizon Mall, Knight’s Market, Ironbridge Crossing, Shadowbridge Arcade, King’s Row, Echo Station, Willowshade Pavilion, Yarrow Plaza, Beacon Tower, Mosaic Plaza, Lighthouse Point, Twilight Harbor, Umbra Theater, Cobalt Market, Jasper Marina, Copper Clock Square, Ivory Spire Cathedral and Brass Lantern Tavern. \nEach of these locations will have a Wi-Fi base station, but the stations are located at varying distances from one another, and some may have overlapping coverage areas. The main issue I face is how to allocate frequencies to these base stations in a way that minimizes interference. I know that if two adjacent stations use the same frequency, their signals will interfere with each other, which will affect the network’s stability and speed. \nThe interference relationships between the base stations are as follows: \nThe Granite Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Silvercrest Observatory, Rosewood Hall, Amber Plaza, Knight’s Market, Ironbridge Crossing, Shadowbridge Arcade, King’s Row, Willowshade Pavilion, Yarrow Plaza, Beacon Tower, Umbra Theater, Cobalt Market, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Silvercrest Observatory has overlapping signal areas with Amber Plaza, Ironbridge Crossing, King’s Row, Echo Station, Willowshade Pavilion, Beacon Tower, Mosaic Plaza, Twilight Harbor, Cobalt Market, Copper Clock Square, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Rosewood Hall has overlapping signal areas with Amber Plaza, Yarrow Plaza, Mosaic Plaza, Lighthouse Point, Twilight Harbor, Cobalt Market, Copper Clock Square, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Amber Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Primrose Boulevard, Horizon Mall, Ironbridge Crossing, Shadowbridge Arcade, Mosaic Plaza, Twilight Harbor, Jasper Marina, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Primrose Boulevard has overlapping signal areas with Horizon Mall, Knight’s Market, Ironbridge Crossing, Echo Station, Mosaic Plaza, Umbra Theater, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Horizon Mall has overlapping signal areas with Ironbridge Crossing, Yarrow Plaza, Lighthouse Point, Twilight Harbor. \nThe Knight’s Market has overlapping signal areas with Ironbridge Crossing, Shadowbridge Arcade, Umbra Theater, Jasper Marina. \nThe Ironbridge Crossing has overlapping signal areas with Shadowbridge Arcade, King’s Row, Yarrow Plaza, Beacon Tower, Twilight Harbor, Copper Clock Square, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Shadowbridge Arcade has overlapping signal areas with King’s Row, Echo Station, Willowshade Pavilion, Yarrow Plaza, Beacon Tower, Mosaic Plaza, Lighthouse Point, Jasper Marina, Copper Clock Square. \nThe King’s Row has overlapping signal areas with Copper Clock Square, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Echo Station has overlapping signal areas with Willowshade Pavilion, Yarrow Plaza, Beacon Tower, Mosaic Plaza, Lighthouse Point, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Willowshade Pavilion has overlapping signal areas with Twilight Harbor, Umbra Theater. \nThe Yarrow Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Beacon Tower, Lighthouse Point, Copper Clock Square, Ivory Spire Cathedral. \nThe Beacon Tower has overlapping signal areas with Mosaic Plaza, Cobalt Market, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Mosaic Plaza has overlapping signal areas with Lighthouse Point, Umbra Theater, Jasper Marina, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Lighthouse Point has overlapping signal areas with Umbra Theater, Cobalt Market, Copper Clock Square, Ivory Spire Cathedral, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Twilight Harbor has overlapping signal areas with Cobalt Market, Copper Clock Square. \nThe Cobalt Market has overlapping signal areas with Copper Clock Square, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nThe Jasper Marina has overlapping signal areas with Ivory Spire Cathedral, Brass Lantern Tavern. \nI need to assign frequencies to the stations in such a way that no two adjacent stations use the same frequency, ensuring minimal interference. The ideal solution is to minimize the number of frequencies needed, as this would lower both the infrastructure costs and the ongoing maintenance expenses.\nCan you help me come up with a solution for frequency allocation to ensure stable and reliable network performance across all locations?\n",
