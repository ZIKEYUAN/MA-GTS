These computers are named: Server Sunflower, Server Twilight, Server Amberwave, Server Windmill, Server Eaglecrest, Server Ghostwind, Server Windswept, Server Firestorm, Server Goldleaf, Server Mirage, Server Darkhorse, Server Blackwood, Server Willowbrook, Server Solarflare, Server Oceanview and Server Tempest. \nTo ensure network security, we need to install monitoring devices (such as firewalls or intrusion detection systems) on some of these computers so that all communication links are monitored. \nAssume that the connections between the computers (i.e., the communication links) are bidirectional.

  "Q": "Our company has 16 computers connected by several communication links. These computers are named: Server Thunderbolt, Server Blackwood, Server Solarflare, Server Moonlight, Server Starfire, Server Stormcloud, Server Eaglecrest, Server Ironclad, Server Redwood, Server Willowbrook, Server Darkhorse, Server Twilight, Server Seabreeze, Server Oceanview, Server Ghostwind and Server Frostbite. \nTo ensure network security, we need to install monitoring devices (such as firewalls or intrusion detection systems) on some of these computers so that all communication links are monitored. \nAssume that the connections between the computers (i.e., the communication links) are bidirectional. This means that information can flow in both directions across any link. Our goal is to deploy monitoring devices in a way that ensures all communication links are covered by at least one monitoring device. \nProblem: How can we select the minimum number of computers to deploy monitoring devices, such that every communication link is monitored by at least one device? \nCommunication links as follows: : \nServer Thunderbolt is connected with Server Moonlight, Server Starfire, Server Stormcloud, Server Eaglecrest, Server Willowbrook, Server Twilight, Server Oceanview, Server Ghostwind. \nServer Blackwood is connected with Server Solarflare, Server Moonlight, Server Starfire, Server Redwood, Server Willowbrook, Server Darkhorse, Server Oceanview, Server Ghostwind. \nServer Solarflare is connected with Server Moonlight, Server Oceanview, Server Frostbite. \nServer Moonlight is connected with Server Eaglecrest, Server Willowbrook, Server Twilight, Server Seabreeze, Server Ghostwind. \nServer Starfire is connected with Server Stormcloud, Server Eaglecrest, Server Redwood, Server Willowbrook, Server Twilight, Server Ghostwind, Server Frostbite. \nServer Stormcloud is connected with Server Eaglecrest, Server Ironclad, Server Redwood, Server Willowbrook, Server Seabreeze, Server Oceanview. \nServer Eaglecrest is connected with Server Willowbrook, Server Oceanview, Server Ghostwind. \nServer Ironclad is connected with Server Redwood. \nServer Redwood is connected with Server Darkhorse. \nServer Willowbrook is connected with Server Darkhorse, Server Seabreeze, Server Ghostwind. \nServer Darkhorse is connected with Server Seabreeze, Server Ghostwind, Server Frostbite. \nServer Twilight is connected with Server Ghostwind. \nServer Seabreeze is connected with Server Ghostwind. \nServer Oceanview is connected with Server Frostbite. \n",
