This means that information can flow in both directions across any link. Our goal is to deploy monitoring devices in a way that ensures all communication links are covered by at least one monitoring device. \nProblem: How can we select the minimum number of computers to deploy monitoring devices, such that every communication link is monitored by at least one device? \nCommunication links as follows: : \nServer Thunderbolt is connected with Server Silverstream, Server Windmill, Server Silverhawk, Server Ghostwind, Server Crimsoncloud, Server Lighthouse, Server Shadowbrook. \nServer Willowbrook is connected with Server Silverstream, Server Bluebird, Server Windmill, Server Silverhawk, Server Eaglecrest, Server Crimsoncloud, Server Windswept, Server Lighthouse, Server Moonlight, Server Glacier, Server Shadowbrook. \nServer Silverstream is connected with Server Darkhorse, Server Ghostwind, Server Sandstorm, Server Windswept, Server Glacier. \nServer Bluebird is connected with Server Thunderstrike, Server Frostbite, Server Eaglecrest, Server Sandstorm, Server Windswept, Server Lighthouse. \nServer Windmill is connected with Server Silverhawk, Server Thunderstrike, Server Crimsoncloud. \nServer Darkhorse is connected with Server Lighthouse, Server Glacier. \nServer Silverhawk is connected with Server Thunderstrike, Server Sandstorm, Server Glacier, Server Shadowbrook. \nServer Thunderstrike is connected with Server Frostbite, Server Sandstorm, Server Crimsoncloud, Server Glacier. \nServer Frostbite is connected with Server Eaglecrest, Server Crimsoncloud, Server Moonlight, Server Glacier, Server Shadowbrook. \nServer Ghostwind is connected with Server Eaglecrest, Server Moonlight, Server Shadowbrook. \nServer Eaglecrest is connected with Server Sandstorm, Server Crimsoncloud, Server Lighthouse, Server Moonlight. \nServer Sandstorm is connected with Server Windswept, Server Lighthouse. \nServer Crimsoncloud is connected with Server Windswept, Server Moonlight, Server Shadowbrook. \nServer Windswept is connected with Server Lighthouse, Server Moonlight, Server Glacier. \nServer Lighthouse is connected with Server Moonlight, Server Glacier. \n",
