These computers are named: Server Seabreeze, Server Silverstream, Server Tempest, Server Silverhawk, Server Emberlight, Server Sandstorm, Server Twilight, Server Glacier, Server Stormcloud, Server Falconeye, Server Windmill, Server Mirage and Server Nightshade. \nTo ensure network security, we need to install monitoring devices (such as firewalls or intrusion detection systems) on some of these computers so that all communication links are monitored. \nAssume that the connections between the computers (i.e., the communication links) are bidirectional.

These computers are named: Server Twilight, Server Willowbrook, Server Thunderbolt, Server Silverstone, Server Stormbreaker, Server Amberwave, Server Blackwood, Server Goldleaf, Server Frostbite, Server Vortex, Server Seabreeze, Server Moonlight and Server Windmill. \nTo ensure network security, we need to install monitoring devices (such as firewalls or intrusion detection systems) on some of these computers so that all communication links are monitored. \nAssume that the connections between the computers (i.e., the communication links) are bidirectional. This means that information can flow in both directions across any link. Our goal is to deploy monitoring devices in a way that ensures all communication links are covered by at least one monitoring device. \nProblem: How can we select the minimum number of computers to deploy monitoring devices, such that every communication link is monitored by at least one device? \nCommunication links as follows: : \nServer Twilight is connected with Server Vortex, Server Seabreeze, Server Moonlight. \nServer Willowbrook is connected with Server Silverstone, Server Blackwood, Server Frostbite, Server Seabreeze, Server Moonlight, Server Windmill. \nServer Thunderbolt is connected with Server Silverstone, Server Frostbite, Server Vortex. \nServer Silverstone is connected with Server Goldleaf, Server Seabreeze, Server Moonlight. \nServer Stormbreaker is connected with Server Goldleaf, Server Frostbite, Server Vortex, Server Moonlight, Server Windmill. \nServer Amberwave is connected with Server Blackwood, Server Vortex, Server Seabreeze. \nServer Blackwood is connected with Server Vortex, Server Windmill. \nServer Goldleaf is connected with Server Seabreeze, Server Windmill. \nServer Frostbite is connected with Server Vortex, Server Seabreeze, Server Windmill. \nServer Vortex is connected with Server Seabreeze. \nServer Seabreeze is connected with Server Moonlight. \nServer Moonlight is connected with Server Windmill. \n",
