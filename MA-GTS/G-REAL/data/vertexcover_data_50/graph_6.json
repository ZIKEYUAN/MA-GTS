  "Q": "Our company has 6 computers connected by several communication links. These computers are named: Server Sandstorm, Server Bluewave, Server Silverhawk, Server Starfire, Server Emberfall and Server Glacier. \nTo ensure network security, we need to install monitoring devices (such as firewalls or intrusion detection systems) on some of these computers so that all communication links are monitored. \nAssume that the connections between the computers (i.e., the communication links) are bidirectional. This means that information can flow in both directions across any link. Our goal is to deploy monitoring devices in a way that ensures all communication links are covered by at least one monitoring device. \nProblem: How can we select the minimum number of computers to deploy monitoring devices, such that every communication link is monitored by at least one device? \nCommunication links as follows: : \nServer Sandstorm is connected with Server Silverhawk, Server Starfire, Server Emberfall, Server Glacier. \nServer Bluewave is connected with Server Silverhawk. \nServer Starfire is connected with Server Emberfall, Server Glacier. \n",
