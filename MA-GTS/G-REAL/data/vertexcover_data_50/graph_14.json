  "Q": "Our company has 14 computers connected by several communication links. These computers are named: Server Nightfall, Server Tempest, Server Falconeye, Server Glacier, Server Goldleaf, Server Moonlight, Server Emberfall, Server Silverstream, Server Stormbreaker, Server Brightstar, Server Ghostwind, Server Amberwave, Server Windswept and Server Thunderbolt. \nTo ensure network security, we need to install monitoring devices (such as firewalls or intrusion detection systems) on some of these computers so that all communication links are monitored. \nAssume that the connections between the computers (i.e., the communication links) are bidirectional. This means that information can flow in both directions across any link. Our goal is to deploy monitoring devices in a way that ensures all communication links are covered by at least one monitoring device. \nProblem: How can we select the minimum number of computers to deploy monitoring devices, such that every communication link is monitored by at least one device? \nCommunication links as follows: : \nServer Nightfall is connected with Server Glacier, Server Ghostwind. \nServer Tempest is connected with Server Goldleaf, Server Moonlight, Server Silverstream, Server Stormbreaker, Server Thunderbolt. \nServer Falconeye is connected with Server Moonlight, Server Brightstar, Server Windswept. \nServer Glacier is connected with Server Emberfall, Server Silverstream, Server Brightstar, Server Ghostwind, Server Thunderbolt. \nServer Goldleaf is connected with Server Emberfall, Server Silverstream, Server Stormbreaker, Server Brightstar, Server Ghostwind, Server Amberwave, Server Windswept. \nServer Moonlight is connected with Server Silverstream, Server Brightstar, Server Windswept, Server Thunderbolt. \nServer Emberfall is connected with Server Stormbreaker, Server Brightstar, Server Ghostwind, Server Amberwave. \nServer Silverstream is connected with Server Brightstar, Server Thunderbolt. \nServer Stormbreaker is connected with Server Brightstar, Server Ghostwind, Server Amberwave. \nServer Brightstar is connected with Server Windswept. \nServer Amberwave is connected with Server Windswept, Server Thunderbolt. \nServer Windswept is connected with Server Thunderbolt. \n",
